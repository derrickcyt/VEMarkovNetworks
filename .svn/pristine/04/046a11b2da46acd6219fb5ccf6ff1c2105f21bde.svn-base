writing up a business email with my right hand
It 's time to embrace the roots
time to embrace the roots of telecommunication
bring on the Morse keyboard
a true must
it 's just too slow
i can speak from experience as
my past lives i have been
i have been a communication officer
that sent out the final message for
"bring burgers and fries !"
did anyone
they did n't
sending important communications such as "headshot
the final push came to get into
to get into germany
"finish him
you can see i have some good experience
i have some good experience with morse code
to say that if you have been
you have been a morse code operator in a past life
It does n't mean you do n't have to worry about
you do n't have to worry about it
to put a keyboard in the market that
that does n't give the "may steal
the "may steal your passwords
warning
Note that this only applies
applies to passwords that you
love this though
I love that I finally
have a way to put my knowledge of
a way to put my knowledge of morse code
it makes typing things out
things out so much easier
I can never go back to those QWERTY keyboards
ca
knows exactly what I
I want to say
my typing speed has DOUBLED since I switched
I switched to this from
use morse code to write text
who knows technology
ll cool j says
cool j says its cool
to send Grandpa a text message
expert mode will impress my friends
to remember
devised
ca n't beat the classics
agree this app has changed the way I
this app has changed the way I type
I can type so much faster now

recommended my friend
my friend to try
I Wanted To Learn Japanese Now I
I Can Must
Try !
dai suki desu yo
updated this app
love it
I wish it have Google keyboard in thailand
Work good on my zenfone
have used for years
I loved this app
I love it
you select the hirogana you 're looking
you 're looking for it gives
it gives you the option to put
the option to put it in katakana or kanji
I downloaded this because students from Japan
Japan came to visit my class
reccommened me to get
me to get this app
I Wanted To Learn Japanese Now I
I Can Must
Try !
it alternates between Japanese and English characters while
while still retaining word completion in both
the mobile phone layout pleases my flip phone loving self
Japanese it makes it very intuitive to navigate
to navigate the hiragana layout
I do n't think you can set it
you can set it to exclusively type in
it to exclusively type in katakana
typing in hiragana there is invariably
Speaking about conversions
it learns very fluidly from the things
I type certain words
convert them
pressing anything else it will suggest
it will suggest the most likely next word/particle so typing titles to books
movies becomes an affair lasting all
an affair lasting all of 2 seconds
I can find so far is
I cant figure out how to import
to import my user dictionary from my PC Japanese IME into
that would save me a heck of
I highly recommend trying out the mobile phone layout at least
see how it treats
it treats you
I avoided using this keyboard ( or IME) because of Google
abandoning its projects
I do n't know how
Google will keep maintaining this
other can keep it going after
it going after Google gets bored
Google gets bored with it
I have tried
Its dictionary seems packed with more than just Japanese lexical items
I try to input the name of a Japanese publisher
an excellent suggestion comes up
no need to cobble up the name with
being as familiar with 12-key or godan methods
I use
I do wish that common Japanese punctuation marks be easily presented
I write
it seems more than adequate for mixing English or alphabet
mixing English or alphabet with Japanese
I switch over to SwiftKey
they know how I write
I write .
I 'm looking for
no need to tap space bar
swipe to get space
All precious grievances fixed
ocheny krutaya klva
Keep updating
I 'm still learning japanese
Nothing can replace it
I tried many input systems
to use
I love the emoji selection
need practice
know how to use
to use firstly
which seemed like cheating
cheating while
I 'm
me knows my password wahah pony
make a kana
a kana toggle please
Thank you for this app
start to learn
needs a much faster way to switch to
a much faster way to switch to the default system keyboard
to quickly switch to the default system keyboard
It takes some getting used to like
some getting used to like writing n
to like writing n 's
The new lollipop theme looks great
a person still learning Japanese
I hope
stay the same all throughout
enjoy the layout of the new version
It 's easier
to type
it resembles the original keyboard layout of the HTC One
Installing other keyboard yesterday just because
Google IME did n't put numbers in same key
have no other complaint about it anymore
that bothers me is when
you select theme black/blue
it shows black/white instead
you give us option to select
option to select pad/key color
want to know when
them release an Arabic Keyboard
. Material design 2. Please
just add the language to the original Google keyboard
I love the original functions of Google keyboard
I want to change it with one touch
I restart my phone
I want to change the "language and input " settings
want to choose the " Google Japanese Input
the " Google Japanese Input " one
have to uninstall this app first
install again
it will work normally again
it 's easy
to type
love the update
to use too
Allows to write precisely
The app works very well
I have n't encountered any bugs so far
I have
no option to change the color of the text highlight
that appears when you type
you type ( set by
( set by default to
I dislike )
I hope we 'll be able
to change the highlight color in the next update
Thank you for this keyboard
It 's really awesome to write in
to write in Japanese on my phone and thanks
I can do it the way it
It 's really helpful
I wish it came with
it came with a small kanji dictionary so
I could learn a few things
I have an lg g2
anyone tell me if there
there 's a way to switch between
a way to switch between the japanese input
english like i do with
i do with english and spanish by
pressing the en or es button on the bottom left side
Thank you
I can speak to my Japanese friends now
!
includes symbols
I make Japanese apostrophes in this new version keyboard
Getting better and better
having english auto correct would be
now typing it too
My phone does n't have a Japanese input keyboard so this
It 's convenient to type
you can easily find the phrases from the drop-down lists
conversing with classmates
you want to avoid using romaji
I type in English a lot
I have is adding a Swype type feature for
you add more symbol to create
more symbol to create more emoticon.
add copy paste
select too

your computer converting romaji input into kanji which
kanji which helps alot for us
us learning the language
has full support for all the cool little symbols
I have found
it 's very useful
to navigate
Just takes some getting used
some getting used to like
to like any new keyboard
You might just need to reduce the app size
who say that it
Just write in Hiragana and Katakana
Kanji will
this wo n't give u the entire keyboard so
the most convenient to use
Easy to use
I love it
to use
Highly recommended
I want it

changing between languages
languages became easier and faster
I have encountered so far so I
I 'm giving it a 5 start rating :D

Thank you for the awesome app
Giving it 5 stars because it
I want to switch back to the old layout
I 've used it for quiet a long time
thought of
changing it
i hate the fact that the new update
the new update removed the 'spam ' "function "
i tap on the same letter repeatedly e.g
the same letter repeatedly e.g a
a suggestion would appear as aaaaa and so on
it 's really irritating especially
what i write comes out as
comes out as aqear/appear/ ch/aaah/
aqear/appear/ ch/aaah/ y/www/( now/before/ )
y/www/( now/before/ ) so yeah
a setting to disable this new fix
I love it
What does "launch mushroom
do
to use
an option to hide the on screen keyboard
The update hides the soft keyboard when I
I use my hardware keyboard in my DesizeZ.
you make the alternative words behind the QWERTY keyboard
be drag down
I use Google IME on my PC
I 'm very thankful to have it
to have it on Android too
it comes to place
to place names
I wish there is a button
a button to change input setting
I 've had an awesome time with this keyboard app
I use it for typing
typing Japanese as well as English
to use
I ca n't send the message without the message
the message popping up to change the input
to change the input setting to
the input setting to automatic
someone help me
I got this app
did my boyfriend
we have tried sending each other messages in Japanese
the Hiragana , Katakna , or Kanji popping up on each others screans
we get question marks and zeros
make this app if you ca n't communicate
you ca n't communicate with it
Does n't get used much
having it there
want to input Japanese
this app does it well
I love it
it works pretty well
I love it ..except that
I can not use the emoji
I lobe it
Nothing word to say
I ca n't find them
you 've sort out what style of
you want ( I prefer
I prefer the romaji lay out
the romaji lay out )
it does the job
Using this for 10month , easy
10month , easy to use
just what i needed
I 've installed Go Keyboard
to use
Cannot choose the Kanji for my typing
Google Japanese Input solved it like a charm
u should install this
Takes a little while to get used to

Surprised more people
Small screen phones its REALLY hard to use 4 finger gestures
its REALLY hard to use 4 finger gestures :C maybe 2 fingers
I 'm
I do n't need advanced gesture support
I need just the basic ones which
I might buy the full version if the need
advanced gestures arise
I 'm good with this
works with my non standard tablet
I do n't understand
i live without this app
it 's got more functions
I have the paid version which works
which works really well
I use this on my nexus 7
Custom gestures allow me to change tracks
me to change tracks without being
being in the music program
even looking at the screen
Does exactly as
it says
It does what is said by
to use
it 's job
I love the 1 finger touch for phones
I get a tablet I will instantly upgrade
I will instantly upgrade to the paid version
recognized every time
tempting to buy the full app
it makes your tablet
your tablet an ipad
my galaxy note .....love it
i can play all my games in full screen
about hit the status bar XD
to use and make gamming more fun
I do n't have use at the moment
I can see it 's done
it 's done well
it does n't recognize some gestures on S3
a must have app next to google
to google 's own app 's
No launcher can beat it
this app has got awesome features
liked these features on the iPhone
i have them on my android
I hoped it
it would
buying full version
It 's one of the first bits
I install
Everything works well
Truly enhances the multitasking experience on a tablet
purchasing the pro version as soon as my new Nexus10
my new Nexus10 arrives
wanted to have this kind of feature
the only reason to root my SGS3
I had an iPad before
I loved the gestures
to get them on Android as
ca n't feel on the speed/battery that the app
Love the new appswitch and launcher animations
to have an easier way to create
an easier way to create custom gestures
drawing them
I loove this application
work well on my china phone
it says
to have gestures like this for
I ca n't describe how amazing this app is
Highly recommended
very well executed app
I got rid of both
the status bar to get much bigger screen estates
it does
getting the paid version
to have pro with no cash
I rooted my device
finger hope pro version is
the most awesomest application ever created
Adds value to android tablet experience
Wish paid version was
would def buy
Another great reason to root your tablet
hated watching videos
reading books before this because of
minimize the dock bar
it works terrific
I will definitely buy this once I get
I get a tablet that can fully use
that can fully use the app 's multitouch functions(
CM9 only has 2-finger multitouch )
Make it works on t
it works on t mobile G2x
Makes it to the point where
to use than a desktop
this app would n't work on your device
give up : ) Connect with developer(
he will help you
My Galaxy S2 home button
replace this function
jump to recent apps
I 'm using lite version
I 've been wanting
I see my friends using
my friends using these nifty gestures
Loving it
Using rooted SE Xperia Neo V
Thank you
I found you
it says beautifully
those people whining about the status bar hiding
u can get a separate app from the xda page
I know in the market is
to hide status bar in android
it would not work in my Zenithink but
he made it
it work
This has changed the way I use
I use my tablet
you 've made for free
you 're the only one that 's bothered to make
that 's bothered to make one so far thanks mate
you need root Love how
Wow works
latest update(full version ) gave me the menu gesture i
i wanted
it says
Some minor gripes include it removing my background
it removing my background when removing status bar
it sends me
My back softkey stopped working on my Optimus G
annoyed not being able to use
to use it
I found this app of course
the gestures work perfectly for what
I needed
I get to learn new gestures to make my phone
new gestures to make my phone even better
A must app if you use
you use your phone continuously
you do
Get it
you waiting for
It does n't get any better than this
it comes to having a responsive system
having a responsive system your fingertips
My tablet feels incomplete without this
this installed
hugely improves user experience
I love being able to view
to view my little 7
tablet in true full screen
Updated
did n't work ... Uninstalled/reinstalled
it works again
have more features
it not work ,you have
,you have noroot
I rooted
it worked like a charm
works like magic
Got a full version
Getting the paid version
wished it
it did n't work on my device so
I emailed the Dec and in
he had given me a link to
the app to try and by the next day had
the next day had it updated in
it updated in the market
Dev added support for tablet
Its a must buy
helped me troubleshoot a problem on my Acer A500
I 'm pretty sure my custom ROM is what
what broke the app
Combined with Tasker integration
this has become a very useful and versatile app
many people did n't know existed
turns out to be the app that
people most rely on
the Next and Previous App switching
carousel effect
this app deserves 5 stars
This app adds so much to the tablet use
I 'm at I can control
I can control with a move of
I want to do
Try it
you 'll like it
Flash player makes it go
it go bonkers and crash
An option to select to have the opposite path also correspond to
the same gesture .A simple example drawing a line from the top
drawing a line from to bottom to
having the same effect.In the simple case of the letter
I do n't always remember which way around I
I have defined it.Ideally the option for a self-meeting gesture
the letter 0 or 8 to begin it at any point
it correspond to the same gesture
A play gesture feature to show the path
Want to buy the pro but bit pricy
worry my next phone cant
I have always wanted something like this
I wish it did n't need root
it did n't need root so I
I could recommend it to friends
Love the app
bought the full version pretty much immediately
Use it countless times per day
it replaces the Better Touch Tool functions I set
I set up on my mac.
I rebooted my phone
it 's working properly
it 's not working for u then
try restarting your phone
apply even when I am
I may want to scroll up
left
that will trigger the gesture there by
taking me to the app for
you do this app so that
it works only on home screen
I 've seen where you can assign
you can assign a gesture to the back button
who do n't have soft keys
Love this app
I 'm a heavy multitasker so was looking
I can minimize use of the home button
I have the tasker gesture and home
screen off gesture active
Had much advanced functions
only needed the basic ones
causes crazy lag while
to see if
It wo n't actually launch custom actions without paid
Paid version seems good so far though
to react
It made my smartphone life real easy
please try to make it for non-root phones also
have credit card to buy d premium R thr
credit card to buy d premium R thr any otherboption yo
any otherboption yo buy the app
i hope you continue to make apps
you continue to make apps like this
This app makes interactions in android really faster

live without it now
using this app
has helped me make this comparable on
me make this comparable on three devices
been jealous of the iPads gesture controls
I got even more
It 's limited use on my phone

My Apps Is Google Play Music

it 'll stay stuck on one word
I want this to be
your other keyboard does n't have this problem
it 's ingenuity
I can customize my own keyboard
I did check all the setting
I typed words
it did autocorrect itself
it 's really annoying
when in hurry
It 's simply the best swype style keyboard out there
Tried them
finding sympbol
Superb loved it
I gave 5star for it
I 've found that this keyboard is
I 've been using Swype for a while
This makes chat and terminal usage extremely difficult
I switch it to a different layout
defeating the purpose of a floating keyboard
I can move/resize the keyboard any time I
I like
Multiling has over any other keyboard is
I can completely adjust how it looks
it looks with sliders
I can also add emotes
I would like to use
I have with this keyboard is
reading the guide or lots of tinkering

to get started with Multiling Keyboard
those unwilling to put in the effort
the effort to learn
installed this again
surprised for all the improvements

you help user for this too
I think that it will be
you do this for us

you dont mind my comment as i
thank you
I recommend this
I 've tried them all
please let us resize the keyboard in
us resize the keyboard in a different way
swipe too high
end up dragging it down my screen

to customize to your needs

more to do with my phone which
Using symbols seems a little quirky at
symbols seems a little quirky at first
you get used to selecting them
selecting them then it 's
it 's actually much faster
a must have app for any android device
a dev to whatch
I will make sure to suggest this app
to suggest this app to as many people as
it 's so fast that i
i 'm going to have to get used to using
using it
the best i 've used
I can think of that I
I can nitpick about is that occasionally the prediction
occasionally the prediction gets a word wrong
that 's kind of like complaining
need to use brakes on a Ferrari
I installed this keyboard for the sole feature
creating a fully custom layout so I might finally be
to tolerate onscreen keyboards
tweaking the colors to my liking
You mean it 's possible
it 's possible to theme
installing a four meg addon
I can control every color independently
praying some developer combines both personal taste in geometry
a color scheme can live with
I discovered that the keyboard already
solved everything I 've hated in
I 've hated in other keyboards in
match the number key row I 've learned on
I 've learned on QWERTY hardware for
to reach
no unwanted crap crowds the main layout
gone from the load process---making the pause
the load process---making the pause between touching
touching a text area
getting typing shorter than I 've ever had
I 've ever had for any Android version or input method
THANK YOU

looking for next updates

to set the keyboard so that in
the split function wo n't make the keyboard

I select another language
I get the whole menu of all the possible languages
I really only need 2 or 3. Same thing goes with
2 or 3. Same thing goes with the language menu that
that comes up from swiping from
swiping from the space bar
I ca n't save colors when I
I 'm customizing the theme

The swipe-to-select suggested words is
It seems natural to allow me
to allow me to swipe from left
me to swipe from left to
expand a large swiping menu when I move
I move up or down 4
I ca n't figure out how to type
I 'm usually a quick learning on
Chinese swiping does not work AT ALL...
I can still use the keyboard like the normal MultiLing keyboard Good Job
I prefer entering with Romaji because
it 's so easy to switch back
to switch back to English
Was informed by a developer that you
you can change to Romaji by
sliding the spacebar ) For the swipe
I think you need the algorithm
you need the algorithm to account for

time spent on a particular letter
longer times means they changed
they changed direction
paused
include your function for auto-correct for when
the user swipes close to a letter

should expect nothing lessfrom this developer

completely FREE from what I
I can tell
using another keyboard again
