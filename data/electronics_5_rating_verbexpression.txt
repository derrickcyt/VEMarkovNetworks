I have been a Sennheiser fan for many years
still have the Sennheiser 414s from
the Sennheiser 414s from the 70s
I wanted a good headphone to go with
a good headphone to go with my Rotel RX-1050 receiver/amplifier because
it reproduces sound so beautifully
I got what I
I wanted
other reviewers have mentioned
I 've had the HD600 for several years
They sound great even on
come alive with the Little Dot Mk III tube amp
Do n't expect a lot of volume out
You need a headphone amp or at least
I hear words sung by
words sung by inarticulate singers that
I realize I
I had previously misunderstood
you have a song where you
you ca n't tell what is being sung these headphones
these headphones can help with that
I 've had these since either 2002 or 2003
I 've heard compares
I had heard many wonderful things about these headphones
to try them
I bought the HD 600
I have n't used the A900 a single time
the A900 a single time since I
I received the Sennheisers
I noticed was how huge they
they sounded compared to my old headphones

Each purchase gave me a sense of
need to move a step up
I purchase headphones I 'm blown
I 'm blown away by the sound
completely satisfied
I purchased some really nice speakers that I
I understood that I like
our ears perceive sound. Now these things still
do n't reproduce the low ends that are capable
you can feel all over your body
owning everything under the sun I
I can say that these keep
these keep me satisfied with
me satisfied with having just the next level
having just the next level of detail retrieval over

cannot compete with speakers .With that
I have had these for 7 months
have used them a lot. I am
expensive and much hyped products fail to deliver
I have nothing but praise for these headphones
I 've always thought people bought expensive audio equipment
people bought expensive audio equipment because the price
the price made them feel like it
these headphones give the most genuine audio experience I
I 've ever had
when listening to Pandora radio 's 192kbps audio streams I
I can hear things in songs
I did n't know existed before
All my previous headphones had a sharp drop-off in performance
to put subtle atmospheric sounds like wind
even violin playing in
I can now both hear
enjoy these subtle additions to the songs.The one thing that
that i find a bit lacking with
a bit lacking with these headphones is
I 'm so used to my super bassy earbuds that

They have a different sound signature than my first pair
I got in the HE-400 as
these have a bit warmer over
The HD600 has a very balanced neutral sound that works
that works well with every type
I 've listened to on them
Some people might say that they
they do n't have enough bass
that 's because these are
they do n't have a boosted bass like a lot

I ordered this for my employer
my employer to change out a backup battery that
a little though to get out of the enclosure
the new one slid right in
it 's still going strong
No issues to report
too much and occasionally cut power from the computer
The codes said it was time
time to get a new battery .Many years ago (
all hate having to replace batteries
There 's
to write here other than these APC replacement batteries last years
a hassle to swap out
I say
Do n't accept substitutes
having to turn anything off
shipped it out.It 's been
out.It 's been a month or so
it 's been great
Purchased from Amazon as I
who may not have been supplying the genuine APC item in light

I cut four slits at the end
dug in with scissors to cut

I 'm new to these types
This lens comes with a shade and pouch
I 'm sure there are
that 's my next purchase
considering this lens
I have to say
I use this with a Canon 40d
You can not imagine how
this will produce pictures that are
You do not realize the level of reduced contrast
You get super fast focusing and sharpness
the F4 apertura have n't been an issue for me.The lens size and weight
you will actually use it more
you 're considering this lens

Canon L Series lenses have earned lavish praise from serious amateurs
being some of the finest lenses available

All I can say is
the sheer weight and price turned me
me off
I bought this lens as my first DSLR lens

I loved everything about it
it weighed about 5 pounds
That may not seem like much
it feels more like 20 when you
you go on a long hike.Around to
I can add about this lens that 's already been said
that 's already been said over and over other than
other than to confirm this is still
I 've not seen or heard of anything in
that comes close to the construction and optical performance
having the f2.8L aperture or image stabilization might seem like
the f2.8L aperture or image stabilization might seem like a handicap
The build quality was

you use an FX camera
I have a Nikon D700
you want to keep on your camera if
you see something
want to grab an immediate shot
Seems that much of the discussion about
this lens centers upon how sharp the 35 f2
mine arrived I put it
I put it to an informal test
that brings it closer to
I love it
use it to take pictures of
it to take pictures of the kids
do n't bother writing reviews
I love this lens on my D300
gives great colors and contrast
I prefer this lens over the 50mm f/1.8
I spent 30 years as a pro
It 's a moderate wide angle for 35mm film cameras
it 's a great lens
a great lens to have
you 're a traditionalist you will love
you will love it
owning a 35mm film camera with a 50mm lens
You may even wish to substitute the kit lens with one
you 're buying a D80 or D200
a good range to have
I own
It works on my DX camera
Most made by far more qualified photographers than
I will say that this is
I have the 50mm f 1.4 Nikkor
love it
I have n't found anything I do n't like
I do n't like about this lens yet
It 's short
It takes amazingly wide angle shots
I like is you can put
you can put the aperture in manual control
I like to have control of that other
I have noticed Lightroom does not have a profile
Lightroom does not have a profile for lens correction
it does for the 24mm
that seems to flatten things out pretty good
this lens will affect the picture
I 've had one shooting session under my belt
acquiring this lens about a week ago
I utilized the &# 34;virtual horizon&# 34
I took with this lens
to see how this lens handled
this lens handled the horizon
I 'd ignore the 1 star review of this lens
misses the capabilities of this lens that
a zoom wo n't have
I wish they had a way
they had a way to protect
a way to protect this lens
Coupled up to my Nikon
Nikon Digital SLR. . . . . .

surprised at the quailty images from this lens .very
to use
I have used in for over 5 years with
I have seen where Ken Rockwell
others have given this lens a bad review
it can turn around
hook to the lens
who kept the lens around from
our SLR days can happily use it on digital equipment
It 's meant for full-frame cameras
I HAVE HAD THIS LENS ON MY NIKON D300
IT IS THE BEST ALL AROUND LENS THAT I'VE EVER USED IN 30
YOU PICTURES FROM CLOSE UP MACRO WORK ( WITH A FLIP
FULL BODY PORTRAITS TO
THE BUILD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT WITHOUT GOING
IT 'S LIGHT ENOUGH TO CARRY
IT WORKS LIKE A PRO LENS
YOU ASK FROM A LENS THAN FAST FOCUS
I bought this lens new about
to use on my D3
Get it
Buy IT
I do n't leave home without for
I thought this lens just to try
to try out what people like about a 'portrait ' focal length.

I find it to be the sharpest lens
I own
It seems to beat my other lenses some of
them being Nikon Micros.Mine focuses perfectly
Nikon Micros.Mine focuses perfectly on my D80 and D300s
I have the Nikon D800
you demand sharpness from a lens
I have used this lens on my Nikon D90
Build quality seems sound
I love this lens
that wo n't break the bank
I do n't own it so I
I cannot compare apart from the specifications
I used it to shoot a cheerleading group
it to shoot a cheerleading group at a night stadium game
you do n't need the speed
ca n't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 Nikkor lens
Nikon dSLR users looking for a good portrait lens
I bought this lens for my Nikon
you 're positioned pretty far from the subject
The manual focus makes it easy to change
to change the subject
I have over a dozen nikkor lenses
I think is better is 55mm f/1.2mm
I admit that I have not used
I have not used 85mm f/1.4 yet
remember 1.4 is
I have seen is amount of chromatic aberrations
you cannot afford or do
need the 85mm 1.4 this is a great piece
it came without a lens cap
you have a grand to burn
a grand to burn ...get the 1.4
I use this with a D7000
which crops the outer third of the image circle
it 's marvelous
I did ALOT of research
research trying to decide between the 85 1.8
the 1.4 has creamier bokeh
I love this lens
I own
It 's very sharp lens
to use it extensively on little children
A must have lens to compliment
I 'm amazed at the clarity of
I 've taken thus far
this lens ....stop thinking about it
just do it
the best Nikon has ever made .If you 're looking
you 're looking for something that
you .Most of my pictures were taken
buing this was futile after
I 'd used one belonging to
one belonging to a friend
I 've tried a number of "portrait
I have had this lens for a while
it has lived on my d700 for
medium telephoto lens its superb
Looking at it is a heavy lens
I could go on
I think everyone has said alot
everyone has said alot of what
I wish
to repeat what people have said of
people have said of this lens
I do n't want anything less so
I got the cream of the crop
I do n't have much to add to
to add to what others have said
others have said about this lens
I 've been using the 85mm f/1.8D for almost a year
I did n't expect this lens to be so astonishingly
I 've read all the reviews
I ca n't afford the replacement for the G version
that came out in 2010
I have 70-200mm VR that I
I used quite often
I 'm surprised that its not depicted more often
Looking through it
that has ever shot with it
The 9-bladed aperture creates beautiful bokeh
you have to hold it in your hands
your hands to appreciate it
i suggest going to your favorite camera store
I own
good one to take pictures of people
read the DPPREVIEW forums
....it does n't matter
I 'm convinced if you could put
you could put the 85mm f/1.4 on a pin hole camera
you would get UNBELIEVABLE pictures
I 've only been using this lens for a few days
you have heard it
it gets for this range/speed
I would say is more useful for
that will not give you even close to
The background bluring this creates at f/2.8 and lower
this creates at f/2.8 and lower is

This autofocus lens remains among the best

It 's also fast in

I started using this lens
Combined with my 70-300mm VR lens
Skip any aftermarket lens in similar zoom range

Built specifically for the Nikon 80-200
Forget the OEM tulips
Does its job
cannot figure out why it 's
it 's so expensive
it said Leica on it
Nikon ?Seems that if Nikon
cared about us
Nikon does not include a hood with the 80-200 lens
does n't need this hood
This fits well as you
you expect from Nikon with
it goes on secure
The rubber lens hood works well
to use
you do n'y have to remove it from the lens
Highly recommended
Nikon got this one right
I looked for a hard/metal hood for
what Nikon recommended
it works great it folds
it folds onto it self
it did n't come with the lens when
purchased

Found this through a friend

I loved this lens on the D40
I love it even more on

I screwed around with a kit lens
I must admit that I have n't got
I have n't got that much new to add
much new to add to the discussion about
It 's just great
I had to come up with one fault of
no hood included
To add insult
This has become my &# 34;everyday&#
my &# 34;everyday&# 34
I cannot say enough about this lens
adds a lot of creativity to
being heavy
want to bring along my camera
It 's light
bought this lens for my D40
It wo n't autofocus on the D40
I read raves about this lens
what can you say to a 50mm lens that
other Nikon lenses costing over 1000.00
have the 18-70 and 28-200
I purchased this for my D60
a no brainer to purchase
Field when used at
a bit loud when compared to other quiet focusing motors
you explain not having it in your bag
my Sigma 18mm-70mm f2.5 had to go in for repairs
a lens to use for the reception that
that would give me clean pictures in
give me that yummy shallow depth
I like for portraits
I saw the price on this lens
thought it was
which means that even though
it translates into more like 65mm
I liked for group pictures
I have feet right? This
a great starter lens to learn the basics of Fstop and depth
I love this lens so much that
I keep it attached to
it attached to my flashless Fuji S5 Pro
carry it arround a wedding or event for
carried a second camera it was just a back
I paid for it
THE lens to use when taking photos of people
It will make you a better photographer
a must have fixed lens for any serious photographer
it had
it would not auto focus with my Nikon D3000
I bought this lens for my Nikon D3200
I cannot give it A good enough recommendation
I purchased this lens to use on
this lens to use on my d3000
made the assumption that it would be
The lens does not have its own AF motor like the AF-S lenses
you see on there was taken
Being new to photography I
photography classes to take to get my feet wet in
I noticed a lot of the classes
the classes require a 50mm prime lens
not wanting to spend a ton of money right off
it has a focusing motor in the camera body
you have to focus manually
it sounds because the camera will still use
the camera will still use the focus module to tell you
the focus module to tell you when you
you 're focused
I 've had bought one of these
got into photography 6 years ago
I love how well it works
it works in low light
it produces looks
looks great
my kid wanted a lens for Christmas
I thought of this lens
It 's affordable
My kid showed me some of

I have used this lens for quite some time
I have used it on an old D50
I love this lens
Not a whole lot to say
Nikon has ever made
bought this for my D90
I use this lens on a D3200
a D3200 ( Manually ) and on
it works
got this lens I tried it
I tried it on my D5000
hated it
used it because I
I had to manually focus it
I upgraded to my D300s
it 's great
It 's a great focal length on a crop sensor
you will have to move around a lot
to get the correct composition
Check to make sure if it has
it has a AF feature for you
I wanted this lens mainly for
hesitated based on some lukewarm reviews for that use case
the reasonable price prompted me to take
me to take the chance
reading so many positive reviews
i have ever seen on a piece of
I 've made
that cost twice as much as
it does
you ca n't go wrong
recommend this lens for anyone looking
anyone looking at a 50mm Nikkor lens
you have a low light lens
Check your camera manual
Do n't worry
you 'll ever use
know that the lens casing and stuff is made out
Some people prefer the more expensive version made out
the more expensive version made out of metal parts
It 's
I bought this knowing I
I would have to manually focus
the new DSLR viewfinders do n't have the focus ring that the old manual cameras
the old manual cameras had so even if you
you have perfect vision it 's
it 's almost impossible to manually focus especially
to manually focus especially at f/1.8 where
I 'm not going to make any cliche remarks about
any cliche remarks about how great this
I will just tell you that I
I took a picture of a flower
all the lights off in the dark
this lens grabbed as though the lights
I do n't care if you
you believe me
can tell that is perfect for
I bought this based on
this based on everyone else
learning with it
you need a 50mm lejns
I would still love to get the 50mm f/1.4 AFS
bought this lens in the meantime so
I could immediately start using my camera
I love it so much I
I plan to keep it on my film body
I can afford the 1.4
I bought this lens for close-up work
I have used it some
some (
I got this lens today
shoot some pics with my NIKON D300
I 've been eyeballing this lens for months
I had a dilemna choosing between
a dilemna choosing between the 50mm f1.4 vs f1.8
reading all reviews from amazon
I came to the conclusion that
stacked reversed on my 200 micro for
I use this mostly with close
it works great
Highly recommend
I have now used this lens daily with
Love love love this lens
It 's so good that I
I 'm surprised Nikon still makes
makes them
I have a Nikon D7000 with a 40mm Macro

all serious amateur photographers should have in their bag
you 're a pro
I purchased this used lens
I 'll admit I
I love this lens

auto focus works just great on my D300s
It 's fast

just being greatfull for who ever figured
who ever figured out VR
I forgot the glory of using
using prime lenses with big apratures
fast shooting with available light
I may have done some of my best photography
I realize why
I do n't know if I will ever take
I will ever take this lens off my camera
it works like about an 80mm
it should yeild pretty good results as a portrait lens
Practice will tell
portraits cause you have to get to close which opticaly
you have to get to close which opticaly produces
which opticaly produces big noses
it 's fast enough for available light shooting
tried in Aquarium and lighting was poor
i had my 50mm with me
I had to shoot with 1.8f
it reduces
I 've gotten into photography a lot
sold it for the sigma 50mm
its HUGE compared to the Nikon
hanging out with fellow camera people is dangerous
I wish I had held on
I had held on to it
it took amazing pictures
you have ( assuming your camera has
your camera has a focus motor
that needs to take photos in low light
You ca n't beat it for the price

to focus manually using
using the D40
I agree

I did a lot of research

our sound quality improved to a point where
we can hear the surround sound/effects at low volumes
compromising on clarity
we had 20 gauge standard cables
you need speaker wire this is
you need to make a run longer than
I say the quality is
the cable does what it

I put it for center
Used thicker cable to connect front speakers just in
I bet this cable will work fine
this cable will work fine as well
I decided to get a new AV Receiver
update my 5.1 system to a 7.1 system
getting the two added satellite surround speakers I
the two added satellite surround speakers I also
ordered the RCA AH16100SN 100 ft spool of 16-Gauge Speaker Wire
I found the wire to be made of
It does have a tracer for running
running the lines correctly from the receiver
you do n't accidently cross them
I did not find any problem with using
using the wire strippers with the 16 gauge speaker wire
I have ever used .By far the best wire for
I do believe it is
It 's speaker wire
say much else about
I looked at less expensive wire
delivered as promised
I know it was a great purchase
it serves the purpose
wiring rear speakers
keeping correct polarity when keeping positive to
Im in process of setting
setting up a 5.1 surround sound home theatre proj
Id did some research as i
do before any purchase to see whats
any purchase to see whats the best price and prod i
the best price and prod i can buy
to work with for it
it 's size
Connected this wire to my Polk TSi500 's
cs10 speakers using silverback banana plugs
Audio sounds great

I 'm using a Lepai 2020A amp to drive a couple fisher
a Lepai 2020A amp to drive a couple fisher 15 " speakers that

it works great
keep that in
you get what you pay
you pay for
I use this cable for wiring
wiring tradeshow speakers
it works fine
Had so few choices at the local R-Shack
it 's a true 14 gauge
Use the proper gauge ( 14 or 16 works fine in
you 're good
to go
Check out Aperion Audio 's web site for
to beat
I used this for installing Klipsch 5.1 Surround speaker
I recommend this
I say its speaker cable
you ask for
Needed a good length of decent wire to run
decent wire to run through our crawl space
to install our surround sound system without seeing wiring
seeing wiring inside the living space
This worked
Great quality audio cable and use to strip
to identify the colors for each one of
I need a light duty wire for 12 volt applications
This works fine
wish I could find the same AWG guage in
I could find the same AWG guage in black to match
black to match power cords
I found this speaker wire ( 14-guage version ) to be significantly more flexible
I expected
I used this as wiring
It bends
I used monster cable payed quadruple the price
monster cable payed quadruple the price it was
time to change cable
speakers .Something that is easily
it does n't cost and arm
the Moster Cable does
Talking about overkill
The twin lead zips and works easily
you have no problem maintaining
no problem maintaining proper speaker polarity
I purchased this ( 100 Ft
wire to fully expand my surround sound speakers
It 's easily routed
to say other than its wire
It 's basic speaker wire
Audio quality seems good
than came with my home theater set
I 'm no wire guru
seems to do the job
color coded
I did n't have to determine which side was
I had to squint to see what side had the writing
what side had the writing on it
it to make sure the polarity was correct
One conductor has a white line on it
Does its job to perfection
I have some extra when I
I need it
Do n't think you need anything more expensive
you need anything more expensive because
it sounds great
Have n't experimented with the more expensive brands so
do n't quote me
buy speaker wire no matter the application
a question to identify
I USED THIS WIRE TO INSTALL SPEAKERS
IT WORKS GREAT
I CAN TELL YA FROM EXPERIENCE THIS IS
YA FROM EXPERIENCE THIS IS TOP QUALITY
would buy again

I attached it
it to
I would use this product again
Easy to use

it promised to do
I have no issue with it.Yea there
it cost a lot more
I upgraded my home theater system
decided to go with 14g wire
16g/18g would have worked )
a little bit worried that being so thick
being so thick it would make it
it would make it difficult to
spools off easily
I have bought this before
I intend to use it for
that sounds as good as my monster brand wire
recommended
I purchased it for use
the previous reviewers have confessed
I bought this to hook up
this to hook up a new set of
which stripped easily to expose
to expose an equally high quality stranded conductor
I have nothing negative to say
to say about the cable
I 've purchased this brand of speaker wire
I replaced my surround sound wiring in
my surround sound wiring in my big room
enhanced the sound as the original wiring was
this speaker wire to hook up two cheap speakers to
I would purchase again if I
I needed any more
I do remodeling my bedroom
I 'm installing this speakers wire for my home theater 7.1
look ugly
I place wire inside the wall
to complete installation
I placed second order for 100 Ft
I did n't realize the size I
I needed
I will recommend it to a friend
a friend should have a similar system to set
a similar system to set up
you say about speaker wire ?It 's a heavy duty wire
that can handle lots of power
long distances.A good quality product...nuff said
to order with the speakers
not have to make a trip to another store to buy
another store to buy wire
I 'm totally happy with this speaker wire
I needed it to connect
it to connect my home theater speakers
the wires has a stripe for an easier connection
It 's wire
Did n't give me any issues when I
I pulled it through a very small hole
It came out intact and ran
intact and ran without issues
best sound quality using 14G wire should be the minimum size
you have high end speakers
Using this wire for my 3 front speakers ( definitive tech )
you plan to run over 40' of
I suggest you buy
you buy 12G or 10G instead
I know its pricey
buy the correct cable
the correct cable 1x
run it 1x than
it 1x than wasting
wasting your money
re-running the cable all over again
you plan to &# 34;upgrade&# 34
you have a pair of those big house speakers
your music sound weak its because the wire
the wire ca n't hold the power
I had to tell my guy that about
can hold the music
sent the signal thought the receiver to
the signal thought the receiver to your speakers and sound wonderful
your speakers and sound wonderful do n't lose quality to your music
It 's wire
It works great
you do n't know
I needed it
I purchased this to run new wire
this to run new wire for my home theater setup
had very thin 22 or 24 gauge wire
desperately needed new wire
did the job
expected
I would highly recommend this speaker wire
other reviews stating they were short
changed on the length
You get what you pay
you pay for
they do make a good piece of cable
Do n't feel like paying more for
paying more for Monster Cable so
I decided to go on the cheaper end
Highly recommended for surround sound systems
buy this speaker wire again
I thought this was much more
I 'd need
then decided to install some rear speakers
All gone now
to say about this
It 's speaker wire
It 's 16 Gauge
It 's marked nicely with a white marker
I bought several of these to
these to setup a 9.2 set
a 9.2 set up

Do n't waste your money on
your money on more expensive
My speakers sound great

that will make your installation easy
receive great quality music
recommend this product and seller
I got exactly what I
I expected
wish I ordered 2 or 300' instead of
I ordered 2 or 300' instead of 100
you ca n't afford Monster Cable this is
I agree with others that
it would make things more convenient
It 's decent wire
you could choke someone with it
Worked exactly as
I hoped
I ordered two of these
it 's speaker wire ...what
I say .It works exactly
.It works exactly like I
I wanted it
it to
I ran it underneath the carpet
Perfect gauge to work with my Energy Work 5.1 speakers on
Easy to work with
Hard to differentiate yourself in the market
i need it to connect 6 speakers
it to connect 6 speakers to my surround sound projectorfor median size
use heavier wire even for short runs
It does n't pay to buy good quality components
cheapen the setup with flimsy wire that
that ca n't carry a good signal
my onkyo htib 20 gauge wire im upgrading my home theather system so i
i decided to also upgrade wire
becareful when striping wire make sure
to cut wire strands
Purchased with a new sound system
it can bend and curve to run along
to run along the walls
I observed no loss of lows or mids or highs
to figure that out unless you
you observe with a crappy wire
Easy to strip
good wire worked well no problems AS
WIRE GOES GOOD PRICE used for home as well as
I have a combination speaker system some of
some inexpensive speaker wire upgrade can do to the sound of
an average speaker set
Cannot complain about this product at all
I needed at a good price
have half a spool left in
a spool left in case I
I need some in the future
to handle and conceal
I run it through the corners
I have n't noticed any interference
any interference .Recommended
complete BS to manipulate customers into spending money
&# 34;more musical&# 34
all say
can only alter the sound of the transducer by
changing the frequency response if the wire is restricting
you keep it from restricting
restricting the load you
you ask
Get the thickest gauge wire you
you can
it 's that simple
you get
there 's nothing about your wire
that will make it more musical
to reproduce
to see
it did not work with the surround sound system that
that had all plugs on the cable
the cable ends
A must for really good systems
It 's as advertised
It has a white stripe on one lead
you can keep your polarity correct for wiring
wiring up speakers
running to my surround speakers in my home theater room

the wattage delivered to these rear speakers
I needed extra speaker wires to install my surround sound system
