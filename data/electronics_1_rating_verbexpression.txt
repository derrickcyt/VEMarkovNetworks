I received the product
I bought a 100-pack of these CD-Rs
these CD-Rs to back up my music collection
I have used Sony DVD-Rs for a long time
This media gives me trouble burning
trouble burning on one of

comes out low at best
Put in any other set of earphones
that has the on/off switch is
Just seems to far from
not far enough
Just does n't seem to clip naturally anywhere
Either to much cord
it does not bode well that I
I think these earphones are poor
Think twice before you
you buy these non-slip headphones
you do n't have those ears
I can rely on Sony for
making a product that has great sound quality
that has great sound quality in a small package
that collects earwax
wearing them for 3 days I
put them on trash ( because

I will never buy anything from this company
I have ever tried to make

Amazon lets them get away with treating

I hold Amazon as responsible as
I will never buy another product from Amazon

they stop and ban this seller from their site
i have been waiting on an answer from
Amazon will go to my spam

all do not think it right
It 's lightweight but sturdy
the locking mechanisms to hold the leg from sliding
sliding up and down just kept popping open
kept popping open by itself
the leg would slide .The tripod is very sturdy
it worked the first 3 times
I 've had this tripod for less than 4 months
used it maybe less than 10 times.
the clamp snapped clean off of
I ca n't help but wonder if the other clamps would snap
the other clamps would snap off similarly in

I connected my digital cable box
I bought two on the basis
do n't have much respect for these Toslink to 3.5mm
these Toslink to 3.5mm Mini adapters anymore after
I found out what a pain it
to have it
use it
I have a MacBook Pro 2.53GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Mid-2009 laptop
tried to use this onto its Digital Output
did my Mac not recognise
my Mac not recognise it
It did n't work when I tried using
I tried using it to connect my phone
it to connect my phone to the speaker
I use for my TV set
my TV set up
a pain to take off my fiber optics cable
I had to cut and pry it off with
it off with my box
does not work as advertised
getting this adapter was so that
I could use my one optical cable with
swapping out the adapter.The problem is that
this adapter fits way too snuggly
I ca n't get it off without
it off without fear that
I 'll break the cable its attached to. So
its attached to. So my purpose was
to avoid buying another cable
I got at least said it was
this says fiber optic to 3.5mm
to 3.5mm mini adapter
bought this product I instantly knew
knew that it
I would also need two converters in order
me to use this product first I
I would need a digital optical toslink to 3.5mm mini OPTICAL adapter and need
I would need a fiber optic toslink
It may say fiber optic toslink
they change the mini adapter part to mini
it can confuse others
Did not meet expectations
perform the task I wanted
I wanted it
it to
I turned out to not need it
to not need it anyway in the end
PS/2 connect only
I read a many reviews about this
this being
cutting edge
it 's dumb
I 'll never trust another reveiw
Card died after two months of
I will ship to Lexar for exchange
use replacement as a back-up
I will never rely on this brand as
work with Camera that supports
that supports the Write Acceleration
I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state
it should clearly state that the 80x speed is
cameras supporting Write Acceleration ! !Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get
this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x )
the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4
SO why pay more if your camera
your camera does not support this technology
you need a pair of headphone cushions

Multiple digital optical sound generating devices going into one sound system is
I expect a lot of people
people have
I have to keep switching optical connections to get the best sound
optical connections to get the best sound from each source--cable box and dvd player
each source--cable box and dvd player to sound system
I figured that someone
someone must make such a switch
I bought did n't work as
did n't work as an actual switch
This thing makes me crazy
intermittent.You have to fiddle around with the cables
to get it to work right every time
it to work right every time you
you switch the output.Great idea
I 'm using the expensive Belkin Pure AV Optical cables with it
I 've had it for a few months
I 've gone to use it
I should have listened to the prior reviews that
stated that this switch was fundamentally
will eventually stop working
It 's flawed presumably b/c there
there 's no protection from dust/dirt
dust/dirt entering the optical paths
This unit would pass some sources
seeing several negative reviews I was reluctant
to try this
a few people had recently had success so I
just fine when hooked together by either

I USED to have Zune for about a month
I could n't stand it anymore
buggy and songs would get deleted

decided to just buy an iPod
threw the Zune in the garbage after
Microsoft would n't do anything to fix
anything to fix it
I do n't understand why people try to avoid
people try to avoid iPods
They work 1
It 's so funny to read all the reviews
to read all the reviews here saying how awesome
saying how awesome the Zune
the software needs a lot of work
I have a little factoid for all
This thing has already broke
it wont sync to the computer
you plug it in right away

NON-EXISTENT.Having said
What 's the big deal
I looked at it in
I checked out the Zune today at Best Buy
have two ipods so was just wondering how
the Zune compared
I tried to keep an open mind
They had the black and brown Zune on display
to wait for the next generation
I experienced the Zune and iPod for the first time
The Zune felt cheap and clunky compared to
I thought the iPod had
the iPod had better screen resolution
seemed like better quality
bugs finally working with Vista
the wireless seems quarky
No one has the Zune yet so
no one to share with
The FM does n't seem to work very well
the Zune having a lot of static
it connects with
It would seem Microsoft would put better quality FM
Microsoft would put better quality FM with the Zune
the features iPod does n't have .The iPod seemed
.The iPod seemed better polished
the interfaces worked better
I would wait if I were
getting a Zune

I had made the wrong choice
I have now had the Zune for nearly a year
I 've had he chance to use one

I did
I thought I might try one

I should not rate it 1 star If
I can rate it Zero Star.
I bought several Media players for my family
Microsoft killed Zune 's perspective at

It 's appalling that they

Unfortunately this one continues the trend.It starts with
the trend.It starts with the software
It 's the strongest point
you do n't need complex installation
The software fails on the 4MP "enhanced " picture from

that to actually get to the menu to start
the menu to start the disc
This machine has always been slow the start
