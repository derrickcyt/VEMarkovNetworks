me to purchase an unknown brand

being overwhelmingly crazy
like the 2 buttons on the side that
page backward buttons
That 's a great feature
I needed until now
I have small hands
this fits my hand well
I 'm used to a smaller mouse
bigger but still compact and easy to travel with if needed
it does n't feel too large either

waking this mouse up was a little
have to click the button on this mouse instead
moving it
I 'm usually on my computer
this keeps the mouse from waking
waking every time little fingers or cat paws decide to touch it.

I have been using this mouse for a few days

Love my Wireless Trackball
I 've used a laser mouse for years
Saw a friend using one of
a friend using one of these and
these and thought it was a great idea
a great idea to have the ball in the thumb position
keeps me from moving around
moving around too much
gave it 4 stars because it
it does n't seem as game friendly
I think that 's more
that 's more of a learning
to use it thing than the mouse
I have noticed the more I use
I use it the better I
I 'm getting
it lasts as long as its not dropped
It relieves alot of stress
has added functionality with the fancy buttons on
to clean the rollerball sensors
I have owned many

you 'll never go back
I used my neighbor M570 Wireless trackball mouse
makes flying aircraft in the Microsoft Flight Simulator Steam Edition a breeze
The right thumb roller ball allows easy aircraft movement as well as
I have an Alienware18 laptop on a small glass top work station
to move a normal mouse around also has an external hard drive and Blue Ray player/writer
using the M570
only using 1/2 of the space
a mouse would use
You could even just set the M570 on your thigh
It does n't have to move
Only your right thumb and fingers move on it
it to move the rollerball
This it my second M750
I have n't found anything else that
that comes close
you want to spend 5 times more money
love it
who spend a lot of time
time working on the computer
You get so used to this type of

I do GIS work
day in and out at
you can manipulate the settings of the trackball

i recommended
I love this mouse
Love these mice
I have been using this exact style for 10 or
This one has a huge working range
I can walk from one room to
look at the screen from more than 20 feet
it 's still working
I ca n't even see the mouse at that distance
I grab a window
keep hold of it to move
it to move around while walking
while walking away
I have not found the end of its distance
I backed up into the kitchen
Most wireless mice have a working distance from the receiver
change it because I am
it rupturing from age
it has no lag
I give this mouse 10 Stars if
It 's also good for those
I recovered from because I
I changed from a regular mouse to
reduced my keyboard use along with special slow exercises
special slow exercises to strengthen my for arms
wonder how anyone gets any work
anyone gets any work done with
any work done with the latter
it will work over a significant distance
Be sure that they keyboard
they keyboard you get to go with

it utilizes Logitech 's " Unifying Receiver " protocol
Love it so far
need to adjust my habit of using
using the regular mouse
I wish the mouse was made
I can feel my hand get tired after
my hand get tired after using it
using it a while
a great option to use with a big screen desktops
It 's taking some getting used
some getting used to
I use this with my laptop
it had a bit of a learning curve
a learning curve to adjust
I 've grown to love this mouse
It does n't completely alleviate my wrist issues from carpal tunnel
it does help immensely
i 've used trackballs thumb one since i
i first bought one many moons ago
love this trackball
I use this at home
have one for work
I love being able to simply set my hand
to simply set my hand on the device
never move it around
needs to move slightly to the right to scroll or
the right to scroll or to the left to click
the left to click the forward or back buttons
No more picking up the mouse
shifting it back and forth
I hated that
I hope Logitech NEVER stops making this wireless trackball
Logitech NEVER stops making this wireless trackball in this style
My only worry before I ordered
I ordered it was being too small
I read couple of complaints
being small
this will work for me
I could n't find another wireless mouse that I
I liked to order so I came
I came back to this one
ordered it
I 'm glad I
I did
It 's great
works great
that complained about being too small
being too small must have
too small must have shrek size hands
you can buy
just doing homework in bed
I 've made for my computer
you have never used this type of mouse
you may hate it at first
It took me 2 weeks to train
2 weeks to train myself to use the first one
myself to use the first one I
I bought
I would n't give up do to
I paid for it
I have one for work and home
I recommend this to anyone
to try something new
Make sure to purchase an extra Logitech unifying receiver so
to purchase an extra Logitech unifying receiver so you do n't have to lug
you do n't have to lug the one that comes
that comes with this around
it 's very small
to forget about )
buy the extra supplemental travel case
I use this
I 'd rather have a wired trackman
they do n't make them any more
this one works just like my wired one
it came in
I suspect that packing my wired
packing my wired on in my soft computer case
what wore out the button switches
I have multiple devices
I own the older wired version of this (
struggled with the earlier wireless version with the massive USB dongle
Highly recommend
I 've bought several of these
I 've ever used
I 'm not too keen on the Logitech Software
I go without it
I purchased this mouse for a job
a job working as a legal assistant
orking long hours in front of
I needed a mouse that would be
I love that I can rest
I can rest my palm over the top
accurately move the documents without looking at
looking at my hand
I would highly recommend
My hand stayed comfortable after hours
I love trackball mice
This one works great
It 's my second purchase of this model
I have big hands
it 's still comfortable
I change mine about once a year
that 's with daily use
it does n't slide around on your desk
Small enough to slip in a laptop bag
take with you anywhere to take advantage
you anywhere to take advantage of the wireless features
like this mouse
i bought it a 2nd time
It has a good range from the computer/laptop
the computer/laptop compared to others I
I 've purchased
keep one at the office
I love this
my husband ca n't figure out how to use
to use it
I can use PC without wrist strain
this works with existing dongle

working with computers
I saw one in the '80s
did n't seem worthwhile to give up the tabletop real-estate
to give up the tabletop real-estate to use
the tabletop real-estate to use the device
Time passes
I 'm in the market for
I decided to give this trackball/mouse a chance
I 'm very glad I
I did
I 've gotten use to using
using my thumb as the human mouse
think it 's
it 's a highly intuitive design
I 'm glad I made
I made the switch
I liked the mouse
Love this Trackball mouse
run out of mouse pad
to use
I had never used a trackball mouse before so this
I bought this after I
I spotted it on a lightning deal
have zero regrets
just a little while to get used to but the difference between
to but the difference between this
I can use this on any surface
moving it around because it
it requires no physical movement
I 've had it for several months
I would buy it again
Love it
This tracking ball works very well
it 's amazing
I have despised trackball mice for my entire life
I used this one
It features the comfort of an optical mouse
requiring the space that one
one does
I do n't know if I can ever go
I can ever go back after using
using this device
wish that there was a current version
I could buy them for work
( security requirements prohibit wireless devices
wireless devices )
Replaced one exactly like it
i gave to my dad
use it on my media PC and
I will never use a traditional mouse again
you have small hands this may not work
this may not work well for you
you basically " cup " this in your palm
I love the thumb cursor as it
it saves my shoulder from moving
moving a lot
it requires a slightly different motion to click
a slightly different motion to click the buttons
I found my hand
I thought it
Loving it

A friend recommended this product to me

space to move when navigating
Set up was

you try to nail a link
Use this for the MM PC in
surpasses a mouse for ease of
I bought this trackball based on
I 've messed with these trackballs on
never actually purchased one
I 've now used this trackball for several hours
work in places where I
I do not have much desk space
trying it
it out
mousing WITH desk space
I spend so much time using
so much time using my computer
my way to switch around with different types
with different types "mouse
even just "mousing " to the right place with
hitting the track pad
to take some of repetitiveness off
requires less desk space
I read several review comments about the track ball
the track ball seeming to have some "friction
moving it around
I experienced this
I removed the ball from the case
simply rubbed the ball against my hands
I got a bit of oil
I " smoothed
made a difference
the ball has been very smooth since then
not being accustomed to this type of a mousing device
preferred the LESS smooth surface of the trackball
I found is that with
I have quite a tendency
quite a tendency to "oversteer
I suspect that as I
I get more accustomed to it
who have never used this type of a trackball
you might try it
it out
you want it to be
you can easily make that modification
people do n't seem to like these mice
I love them for gaming and art
Easy to cobtroll and best if you always
have a cluttered busy work space
having this since December
I will not go back to any other pointing device
This works quite well for gaming
no "wireless " lag like j have seen
j have seen in older wireless
pointing devices .My only issue is
you cannot change the sensitivity of the device
I had robust a grip lad to keep it
robust a grip lad to keep it from sliding (
noticed lol )( E.g
Using the additional buttons to adjust
the additional buttons to adjust sensitivity
Been using trackballs for over 15 years
I love these
purchased what I think is
I think is maybe my fifth one
I 've been buying them
they came out since somewhere
i 've replaced them because I
I lost them
left them at a previous job
replaced after six years because the little pads
that kept it level
itself would barely work 2 feet away
time to buy another one
this one dies
i 'll buy another one
This works great
turn it off
has a clever little storage space for the USB dongle that
that comes with it
I had bones hitting bones
bones hitting bones in my wrist
this helped out so much since
need to move your thumb to move
your thumb to move the mouse
I would choose to use this over the laptop trackpad
I love this mouse
The ball spins nice and quick
you can place it where with
The wireless dongle can fit in side of
Talking about battery
You might ran into trouble to use
trouble to use this mouse to paint or playing
this mouse to paint or playing FPS game
daily bases use . Why move
move your hand while just move your thumb
just move your thumb to control it
your thumb to control it right
?
Love it
I owned this type of mouse
to have it back
I can sit on my couch
work no problem
Lighter and smaller ball compared to the logitech marble mouse
I find it more accurate
comfortable to move the ball with both my index and thumb
use the buttons with the other fingers
using the thumb alone can be imprecise
Took a few days to get use to
a few days to get use to the new mouse/style
Battery lasts
I 've had it for over a year
I use it 6-7 hours a day
I 've yet to replace the battery
I have found in years

controlling it
I bought 2...one for work
nice and easy to use
I love this mouse
I 've had it a little more
I use it every day
I bought two of these
I had lasted about 4.5 years before
The buttons started randomly double-clicking
when working in Word or Excel
the button would n't register as 'depressed'
the cursor would stop highlighting
release my selection before
Repairing it is
chose to replace it.This is the only mouse that
that does n't hurt my fingers
create a carpal tunnel flare
I love that you control
you control it with your thumb
It 's a great add on
a great add on for a touch pad laptop.The battery
a touch pad laptop.The battery lasts long
it works great for several years
it 's
to replace
A win in my book
I love this mouse
It keeps my coworkers away from
messing with my computer
get amusement from them scooting
them scooting it across the table
the pointer moving
I love not having to move my hand around all day
all day to navigate my screens
My whole family loves these
My left-handed husband uses one
I have one for every computer
they 're
I have no clue why people
people use the more common mouse that is
moving all over , etc
great easy to use
My wrist gets fatigued
usually hurts after a few hours of regular mouse use
switching to this mouse
I can def
feel the difference
has a scroll wheel as some ergo mouses
some ergo mouses do
one died after 2 years of
picked up another with the protective case

you will need the software

recommend
I bought this as a backup
going strong
you need to pop the ball out with
the ball out with a finger
wipe of the three contact points with a Q-Tip
a week or so to keep it operating
it operating smoothly
I will never go back
I started using these at work
to relieve some CAD-related stress in my wrists
I 've never had a problem since
I had previously tried a vertical mouse
do n't believe a word of the marketing
The constant pinching adds a lot of strain
I used a Logitech wired trackball for over a decade
I wore out the buttons
I bought this to replace
this to replace that one
to take the ball out from
the ball out from my old mouse
put it in this one
Having used a track ball for several years I
I can only say "best Track Ball ever "

I believe
the ability to use with LEFT HAND
pressed.They do have a single flaw
looses its grip to the inner plastic wheel(
This causes an issue with scrolling
scrolling unless you press harder and then
you press harder and then it can cause
it can cause numbness in the finger
the finger tip.To fix this
turn the mouse over
Remove the visible screw
pry the left top corner black sticker pad off to get to
to get to the hidden screw.Remove the Wheel
Clean any lint / hair off
the rubber wheel meets the inner plastic wheel
place a small drop of super glue
Let dry and put
dry and put back together
get many more hours of use
I 've needed this for a long time
Love it
a bluetooth mouse paired on a cheap HP 15

My first one survived heavy use for 2 years

The buttons respond well under pressure (

I needed a replacement for my previous Logitech mouse
I opened it up
"repaired
I did n't want to bother with it again.That
they do n't make that model anymore
The M705 comes darn close
It 's all in hardware , not software
I 've encountered is the Logitech software in
Windows causes the forward/back buttons
to work for some programs
I had with my previous Logitech mouse
I removed the software and voila
works perfectly again. I hope this mouse

What impresses me most is
how long one set of batteries can last
batteries can last in this mouse

it 's alot longer than other wireless mice
I 've owned
you can use this mouse with only one battery
you 're concerned about weight

I love this mouse because
I cannot use a mouse without it

This mouse does not seem to have some of the issues
I experienced with previous generations of
flywheel gets old
single click to double clicks
clicks (ouch
You can fly with only one of
two possible AA batteries installed which makes your mouse
which makes your mouse much
this mouse has is the little button just
a horrible place to put that button
could not stand it
trying to use your mouse while being poked in
being poked in the finger continuously
ruined a great mouse
I say almost because I
I found a video which showed
which showed how you can carefully take
you can carefully take this mouse apart
remove that button
Be aware if you attempt to do
you attempt to do this that you
to do
you can see places where you
you can break things in this process
I 'm taking a star off for
I cannot imagine why an engineer
an engineer thinks
thinks apparently that we want to be continuously poked
we use our mouse .Overall
I 've used
I used to love the VX Revolutin
they had all sorts of problems
I have not seen on this mouse
I 'll have to take this one apart now
hope I do n't break
I do n't break it
I needed

being large enough to be
I did n't notice any appreciable lag
I did n't experience any cramping during extended use
I experienced some occasional errant movements while using
using the mouse on a dark hard wood table
the pointer moved as expected
own a Logitech G502 Proteus Gaming Mouse for
have found it easy to switch between
to switch between the two despite the M705
has the dual-mode scroll wheel
I appreciate that Logitech carried this handy feature
that Logitech carried this handy feature over to
offers great flexibility in altering the functionality
altering the functionality of the mouse 's extra buttons
I would recommend this mouse
would buy it again
Needed a new mouse
went with this based off
this based off the fact that
the batteries last so long
I 'm thinking its because it
it uses 2 AA batteries instead of

do n't use the button
find that feature
you can disable OR reprogram that button

I went looking for a replacement
I checked around
bought two wildly different mice
discovered the trackball design drives me
the trackball design drives me crazy
I 'm a big guy so this mouse
this mouse fits my hand perfectly
the chunky M705 might feel awkward in a small hand
packed with a laptop.One unusual feature is that
this mouse takes one OR two AA batteries
I found it feels too heavy
it feels too heavy with two AA batteries
it works great with just a single battery
uses the superior 2.4GHz wireless technology as opposed to
I 've read a number of reviews

Short versionThe mouse has perfect functionality

leave it there
you should n't lose it
you do lose it
I believe you can always get
you can always get a replacement
the mouse has a slit for the adapter
safekeeping to prevent any loss from happening
the mouse does lose the logitech logo
this mouse gets 10 starts
I could rate it that high
I use it with my MacBook Pro
Thunderbolt display
cradles my index finger
to use all day and with intense activity
Going to buy a second one
THIS IS A GREAT MOUSE.
I have n't replaced a battery in over a year
this has been the most comfortable mouse I
I 've ever had
Most others have hurt on the sides after
gripping for so long
hurt my wrist after a while
This one does n't do any of that
I had bought another Logitech wireless mouse
liked the freedom on not having a wire
not having a wire to deal with
a wire to deal with .
I did n't care for the wheel much
I felt it turned a little
it turned a little too freely
I had been from the wired mice that
I 've used in the past
I had a hard time scrolling
a hard time scrolling pages
such , kept going too far
I felt I did n't have
I did n't have enough control
I did a search on wireless mice
that had a more " clicky " wheel
came upon this mouse
I read seemed to sound good
you can engage to make the wheel more " clicky"
I ordered it an have been using
an have been using it for a few weeks
I have to say that I am
Button to engage the clicky-ness works
the clicky-ness works well
I feel like I have
I have as much control as I
I did before
I do n't accidently hit them
I have n't really got used to using them
to using them either
you 're looking for a wireless mouse that
that had a wheel with more tactile feel
you ca n't go wrong with this one
It 's a little pricier than other ones
I feel it was worth
the battery lasts 3 years like
it claims
have I been using this
I been using this now
serves as the worlds greatest entertainment set
the worlds greatest entertainment set top box
I seem to remember buying them as a set
I have had no problems with this product
Takes a little getting used to but
a little getting used to but like
to but like it
love the ergonomics of the mouse
recommend it
I 've bought 3 of these
I travel so I am
I hoped it might be
I did n't think I 'd like the mouse-wheel
I 'd like the mouse-wheel toggle so much
It allows a ratcheting mouse wheel or free-spinning
use it in ratchet mode
I want to swing from the bottom of
I can hit the toggle
spin the wheel
it goes all the way to the top
Bought this to replace my mouse at work
Love the battery life on this

my hand off to reach the buttons
my Revolution broke
I love the MX Master.It 's comfortable

I skipped the Performance that was supposed to be
I 've heard
the MX Master took me a day or two to get used
a day or two to get used to as my thumb
my thumb hits the back button fine
It has all of the options
the scroll wheel containing a left and right click button
form that
it has the free scroll on the center wheel
I 've come to love over
to love over the years
the ability to connect via Bluetooth

I 've put it on
I use it daily for
I 've had to charge it in about a month
I plugged it in via

easy to use
thought I 'd pay as much as I
I 'd pay as much as I did
I did for a mouse as
I did for this one
I thought this was going to be
has a nice weight to it
I have n't downloaded the customization software
I had an old mouse that had
that had side buttons
I would accidentally press them on occasion
I do n't find myself accidentally pressing
pressing the side buttons because I do n't have to grip
I do n't have to grip the side of the mouse
it has the thumb rest
it does n't actuate unless you give
you give it a good press so
I do n't have to worry about hitting that
hitting that one .The connections for
I needed
my computers does not have bluetooth so I
I use the included adapter
it saves three connections
I can have my laptop using bluetooth
my laptop using bluetooth without having to use
having to use the wireless usb adapter that was included with
also my laptop doesnt have the old standard usb connections so I
I figured I would see if
I would see if the stone one matched
the stone one matched my topre realforce keyboard in the typical beige color
they look pretty nice together so
I got it
I 'm a programmer
go through mice regularly
I went back to a wired mouse
This thing runs forever on a charge
it got low
to plug it in
charge it while
using it
just press down with your thumb and switch screens
I use it with my desktop
my Surface Pro 3 being able to use
to use the USB dongle and bluetooth
switching profiles on the fly is
The mouse has a nice shape which makes
which makes it nice to use
to use much like the Logitech G700s in
it would have been nice if it
it used user replaceable rechargeable AA batteries
a must as it
it lets you rebind the keys/buttons
lock/toggle the middle scroll wheel if you
you dislike the SmartShift scrolling
want to lock the mouse to either free scroll or ratchet scroll
I love it
it !
I love all of its features
to use
like how it shows all
it shows all of the open windows
I can switch back and forth so easily
love how it knows which window
it knows which window I used

I had the Logitech Performance MX mouse previously
I love having the bluetooth option that allows
that allows me to quickly switch between
me to quickly switch between different computers
I have 2 of these mice
the bluetooth connection will drop once in a while
it 's very easy
to reconnect
I would definitely recommend this product
I 'm a graphic desinger
did n't think there were any really good mouses
to use
I use this now
It comes with a charger which
which means you do n't have to change the batteries
you do n't have to change the batteries all the time
I hope you guys find
guys find that this Mouse suits you
you becuase it certainly suited
suited me
I 've ever had !
I purchased the Mouse :Hyperscroll wheelThumb ScrollLarger sizeBluetooth connectivityAndroid compatibilityconnect to
the above exceeded my expectations except the size
They require bending thumb unnaturally
Looks like they were designed to be sleek
opposed to functional.Price is a bit highMouse
I do like the thumb rest. I
I do n't use the clicky function on the center scroll wheel
works best as pure hyper. I
keeps up.This
small enough to use as a travel mouse.This
works great on my LG V20 smart phone .On
this mouse makes working in Excel easy
thumb scroll moves sideways. I did end
I did end up buying two of
my to go electronics bag
I do n't know about reliability
I have only been clicking this mouse for a month.
I do n't know how this works
this works on apple products
the side scroll does n't seem to function in MS Office? There
that looks fragile
I would recommend against dropping it.This
dropping it.This seems to work on
it.This seems to work on any surface
Everyone should have hyperscroll
people function without it
I can no longer live without side scroll
I think the right price is
I paid the extra ( twice ) cause the features
the extra ( twice ) cause the features are absolutely necessary
This might work better for average size people
I use it to flip back and forth
it to flip back and forth between my two imacs
I have installed it for use
works prefect
I had a chance I should buy
I should buy a travel mouse case for it
FCP X has never felt better
makes computer use as a whole so
a whole so much easier
You can multi-task
etc . Worth every penny
I will never buy another "unsophisticated " mouse again
I love it
I 've ever used
100 % impressed with the fit
I 'm a CAD
a CAD drafter
this mouse meets and exceeds all expectations
The programmable options using the Logitech software is
I 'm amazed at the quality and design of
They hit a home run with this one
I 've ever used
I have medium sized hands
it fits great
I think the shape with the integral thumb rest
to get used
to .
I replaced another wireless mouse that was
I did n't realize just how bad it was
I got this one
I use Sketchup as part
Connected to my Macbook via the tiny little USB

I have had no challenges with use
each side .Speed setting for the roller are
to adjust with the neat little logi-app I installed
I installed on my mac. You
You can change the wheel from smooth

seem to last a very long time
it has charge indicator lights near the thumb-rest.Extra wheel and buttons
Have n't needed to do much with them .Works
them .Works great on any surface
I have tried
especially compared to a bluetooth mouse.Cons ;wait...I 'm thinking

you give it a chance I
I 'm sure it will easily become
it will easily become your favorite mouse
enjoy this new done color option
I love this mouse
that can connect to three device at
I 'm using this in Fusion360
Review coming soon
build responsive and beautifully designed mouse
its what I
I wanted
it does take time to get used to
time to get used to after using
after using small mice for so long
I have to say is the sexiest mouse
I 've ever seen
I prefer human ) It has
It has an interesting scroll option
a click puts the scroll into a smooth and fast nonstop scroll
click again
Has helped relieve some wrist pain
Have had no problems on any surface
! Very smooth
Needs drivers to get all functions on Mac
installed it 's
it 's great
Use it in conjunction with
fits a big for my hand
I 've ever had
I have used several performance mice over the course
I 've ever had
gave it 4 stars because the battery life
did some research
found out that connecting using
connecting using Bluetooth does use more power
Bluetooth does use more power than connecting
connecting via rf " Unifying"
I 'm going to give that
see if
it improves
made
Will feel phenomenal in your hand
looks great while
doing it
someone broke through my window to take
my window to take my backpack
I have to buy another one because no other mouse
no other mouse will compare to this
I use it for gaming
Would recommend 10/10
I expected
need to get from one area of a worksheet or file
The wheel has a " clutch
Start spinning the weighted wheel spinning
remove your finger from the wheel
it goes for a short or long time
the spinning stops leaving the pointer on screen
you asked it
it to go
Windows 10 lets you choose between all open applications
it saves you finding that
you finding that on screen
save a ton of time
feels like it
it will not last forever
heavy enough to feel good in movement
I would buy a replacement if this
this lasts a year
I 'm missing in it is
I have itnand use it a lot for
browsing
they removed this feature
I miss it .On the other hand
it releases the wheel to run
the wheel to run freely
sets it back to
step" scrolling while
One mouse to rule them all
works on glass surfaces
time to replace our mx performance mouse
believe thats because it has
it has a built in
a built in battery
I expected
a must for people using
people using computer
I switched from a Magic Mouse to
no regrets
I miss from the Magic Mouse is
you can customize every button with Apple feature
it 's awesome
makes my workflow faster.Advice
using the Bluetooth than USB when
you have other Logitech devices on Mac
I 've used
I use it for gaming
It 's very rare to experience
to experience lag
It feels extremely comfortable
I ca n't use the middle button and thumb button or gestures because Logitech
Logitech wo n't release a driver for linux.The
linux.The battery usually lasts me
lasts me over a week
leave the plug near the mouse so
it gets low
I can plug it in quickly
keep using it
I see no sign of wear.The programable buttons
I can export multiple web images in fraction
programed shortcuts .Would recommend to all designers
Better fit for larger hand
recommended
Works as expected
I work from home for
I have a company issued laptop
a company issued laptop running
laptop running Windows 7
I do lots of data analysis
I purchased this mouse to work with
this mouse to work with that computer
I realized exactly how
I fell in love
I did not realize it was so customizable
ordered it
I run my personal Mac

I end up using at least as often
the build quality are also
the mouse looks very good.Personally
I find the horizontal scroll wheel
I press pretty much only by accident
it 's just a matter of
super tiny and awkwardly placed on top of
pressing only one is a matter of
I 'd rather have no horizontal scroll wheel

Has come quite a way from the rather mediocre software Logitech

It worked perfectly right out
have high hopes for long battery life since
I have previously purchased the cheaper optical mice by Logitech
them had a substantial problem with the mouse
moving the mouse around
This happened so frequently that those mice
I decided to try the MX Master mouse because it
it has a laser sensor
I have been using it for about a week
it has not skipped even once
Will update this review if I
I have problems
Bought this to replace the previous generation of Logitech Mouse
that has been completely unfounded
I get over a month 's worth
I plug it into a Micro-USB charging cable
I can use it while it
I have not used it with multiple machines
I do n't want to mess around with lifting
lifting the mouse
changing the " channel
a handier method to accomplish this without lifting
lifting the mouse off the desktop
I might make use of that
Not worth reducing the review over that feature
that feature ( in my opinion
I do n't need the spreadsheet functions
the spreadsheet functions much
the horizontal scrolling has been a handy feature when I
work with a large spreadsheet.Great product
endorse it
Use this on my MAc
it works really well

I will likely purchase another one for my other machines
feels great
I find myself recharging
myself recharging once a week
I 've used a previous version of the Logitech rechargeable mouse
that uses a AA battery
it worked on a charge
This mouse uses a lithium battery
lasts weeks without a charge solving
a charge solving that problem.The real upside of
that allows you to have the normal wheel
you to have the normal wheel clicks when
the normal wheel clicks when you want
you want them
you flick the wheel to scroll
the wheel to scroll a great distance
allows the wheel to free-wheel allowing

I love this mouse ..It 's really great

you want from a mouse
Only time will tell how
it lasts
it seems well constructed
I purchased years ago at
changing the mouse speed on the computer
This meets all my expectations
I would definitely buy this product again
you want just a basic mouse
I wanted a simple mouse that would be
to hold
cost a lot
have the basic three-buttons-plus-a-wheel functionality
It works with no problems
it 's also pretty light
to manipulate with just fingertips
you prefer a lighter touch ...exactly what
I wanted
I 'm
the symmetrical shape means it 'll feel exactly
it 'll feel exactly the same to
it does to me
you 're just looking for a mouse to do
a mouse to do its job
I do n't think you can do better
you can do better than this
It 's cheap
It works
What else do you want? I suppose
I suppose you could go cheaper
you could go cheaper if you
wanted
you 'd lose two things
you will probably lose brand quality
Logitech has been around for a long time
a long time now making mice
they keep on working years
working years after you
you buy them
you get 1000 dpi
I prefer my mice at least somewhat
the 1000dpi gives me that
you have small real estate to move your mouse
small real estate to move your mouse around in
you keep having to pick up
put down your mouse due to
hitting the edge of your mouse pad or mouse area )
your mouse pad or mouse area ) then higher dpi is
the way to go
I have several of these and
all work fine
My product arrived in good shape and
I have no complaints
I got the mouse a month ago
I love it
It took me a day to get to used
a day to get to used to a super-responsive mouse

dealing with the delay and heaviness of a wireless one
It works great
It 's been working fine for me
I recommend
My computer positioning does not allow a direct view of the mouse and so remote mice
This wired mouse works quite well
the long cord allows it to be snaked under and
it functions as advertised. I
I would recommend this mouse to others
received
I plugged it in

I can not have any negative comment on it
described by seller
I recommend it to everyone
who 's looking for an affordable cord mouse .Best Wishes,--

my laptop has been acting increasingly flaky lately

I tried changing the battery
it did no good
The thing has been used too much over the past four years

it ’s time to get a new one…My choice
time to get a new one…My choice for a replacement

became obvious that I
I chose very well
it ’s full-sized
It fits much more comfortably in my hand
it feels rock-solid without being
being heavy or cumbersome
I found setting up
setting up the mouse
putting it into operation very simple
I took the mouse out of
its blister pack ( probably the most difficult part of
I opened the battery compartment
put in two fresh “AA” batteries
took out the nano radio receiver from its designated slot
I closed the battery compartment
put the tiny radio receiver into an available USB slot on
The mouse started working.And works very well indeed
It points with great precision
the mouse buttons click softly without being
being mushy
the mouse wheel turns easily through several detents
I can use to navigate web pages when I’m online
The also work very well
I think their positioning is perhaps
to customize all of my Logitech M510’s
using a free app that I downloaded
I downloaded from the Logitech web site .Only time will tell
the Logitech web site .Only time will tell how durable and reliable my new Logitech M510 Advanced wireless
that earns my highest recommendation
I have many of these Logitech mice
They work very well

My original apple mouse died after 4 years
this one works flawlessly
I 've had it for 3 months
have only had to plug it in once
once to recharge
they 'd move the charging port to the front
you could use it while charging
I to tell apple that their design
it replaced
Love that it recharges instead
it recharges instead of using
using batteries
you do n't have to fiddle with the bottom plate
Apple took the perfect mouse
made it better
it has a rechargeable battery that uses
that uses a lightning connector to charge
you have another device like an iPhone or iPad
you have these cords already
this one comes with one more
having to buy batteries again is
I hate
hate
hate buying AA batteries constantly
hate buying rechargeable batteries that do n't hold
that do n't hold a charge
that take hours
hours to recharge
The mouse looks and feels the same as the previous generation
I 'm sure the design team will balance
the design team will balance a form

which had its axle completely sheared
sheared off

I had become reliant on the multiple thumb buttons
The Scimitar gave me more of

FOREVER trying to find an appropriate driver through Windoze Update
never found anything ( running
running Win7 Pro 64 )
What made matters worse was
I did n't even have rudimentary mouse functionality
meaning the pointer was frozen in place
the main buttons did n't work
I had to use the keyboard to force
the keyboard to force a restart
wait for the system to go through
the system to go through a boot process much longer
it did n't recognize the mouse )
the CUE software recognized the mouse
I have a Corsair K70 RGB keyboard
running and got the mouse
the mouse going
it tells you to plug the mouse
you to plug the mouse in before
downloading the driver ( CUE)
You should actually download
install CUE with your old mouse before
plugging the Scimitar in.All mouse functionality beyond the basics is handled
Setting up the mouse lighting
it 's actually less complex than the keyboard configuration
I said earlier
you can set each of the four RGB
the four RGB LED zones to have one
zones to have one of four independent lighting schemes
I had to turn the intensity almost all
all the way to black to keep it
the way to black to keep it from

disappointing.The articulating arm works very smoothly .For limited use
it 's great

You wo n't hear creaking at all probably due to

Does not feel like too much plastic.3
The mouse seems very good
I have not had any glitches of any sort
using it

mice do n't have this as they
they turn off after inactivity
I have had a lot of instances

turns on my PC while it
I ca n't stress enough how good having an on/off switch
enough how good having an on/off switch is
turns off after inactivity
inactivity to save power.5
a compartment to store the USB connector so that
I do n't lose it when carrying
carrying around
it 's still good to have

The mouse does n't come with one
the ergonomics make using it for an extended amount
I have to say personally
can feel " cheap
I would suggest is
to remove the gloss finish
it can get a little sticky when the moisture
the moisture builds up on your hands
This came well packaged
to open
I plugged the dongle into my computer
it recognized it immediately
It uses two AA batteries
it arrives
it 's a good mouse that does
that does the job
that feels as responsive as a wired mouse
this mouse worked flawlessly
It has all the utility features of more expensive gaming mice
missing the colorful lights that some
some have
( Did not have an issue with my dark blue mouse pads
some past devices would not always give smooth results
you ca n't do better
you thought that mouse tech
that mouse tech had peaked
I 'm
using this mouse with it 's
it 's ability to change DPI

you 're not using so you wo n't lose
you wo n't lose it
I 've accidentally left the mouse on for
while not being used
came back to the mouse
the mouse still working
I have used in all my years experience
I love the feel of the thumb area
recommend it for anyone who
uses a mouse ( as I do
I do since I do
I do translations 8 hours a day )
will buy another for my computer
this mouse comes in at a good time
the TECKNET Model M006 2.4 Ghz Cordless Mouse:The Pros :** A nice large "man size " mouse which fits
which fits my large hands quite well
feels natural
The 2.4G Wireless USB receiver came stored in the base so
taught me right off the bat
a good place to keep it when
My Apple MACBOOK accepted it without blinking showing

I tried several different surfaces to see if
several different surfaces to see if I
I could trick the mouse

I could not

I tried it on a marble coffee table
which had lots of angular crystals
angular crystals showing through the high polish
could tell no difference in operation from
do n't need a mouse pad with this
a time working
I put the mouse pad up because
you tend to exercise your fingers a bit while
using a mouse like
I do
you will make less mistakes
the mouse has a dedicated on/off
a dedicated on/off switch which
I like
you do n't really need it as it
it has a built in
a built in timer
will turn off by
I want to
30 months depending on conditions
a dark mouse pad draws more energy than a light pad
I would assume if you like
to sit there
wave the mouse back
forth to make up your mind on something
you would use more battery there too
Only time will tell whether this
pushing the wheel button down
forgetting to use the mouse for a long time
the mouse goes into its energy saving mode
it has to do this .**
warns that use under other operating systems
other operating systems may reduce mouse functionality such as loss
the mouse takes to my MAC like
Am I in a small group
I can only tell you it works
it works fine on 10.7.5.The Cons :The only issue
I had was when I
I initially received the mouse
I opened the package
did not see the Wireless USB
It 's human nature I think to do
I think to do a quick inventory when receiving
receiving a new product so I
I wrote the company
reported this
waiting over the weekend for a reply
I took out the mouse
opened the battery cover to verify
the battery cover to verify what size battery
stored in a small slot made for
a small slot made for storing it
know to look at this for any future mice
I did feel a bit uncomfortable at first.All
an easy mouse to recommend
it works this well for my old Apple

cares about their equipment
I will keep their products in mind
this makes using a Laptop again

This makes web surfing much easier
no need to carry any unnecessary wires
you need two AA batteries
You can change the sensitivity
which affects how fast the mouse moves
the mouse moves on the screen
I have is that you
you will have to replace the batteries because
you need a mouse to use on
a mouse to use on the go by
flipping a switch
the mouse to go
I like a bit more
It has some extra buttons at the thumb
The wheel give some feedback when you
it lets me know that I
I 'm using it

hate getting a box that you could fit
you could fit 10 of the products
no excess.Upon opening the packaging I did
I did what almost every guy
every guy does
pulled out the paper instructions
chucked them aside so I
I could get the mouse
design feels well made
I noticed the USB dongle for the mouse stores
lost one of those dongles
putting the batteries in
it fired right up with the normal drivers
I have found useful is the button
the button to change the resolution
I have been using this mouse at work
would certainly buy it again
I have had multipole tecknet mice

you would expect
It fits my hand so comfortably
Must buy

I let him
him out
tried a bigger live trap with a spring control on
kinda throws the little guy on into
I came back to that trap
Made me so sad
I had to bust that trap up
throw it in the garbage
I put a paper towel down in
my guest got nervous
added a blob of some kind of
left it in the darkened kitchen
I got up in the morning
the morning to check
me to see any residents from a safe distance

he came in through
I could still see the edge of his fur

it works well for our needs
to buy this product
some people seemed to have trouble with registering

getting support
I do n't want to insult their intelligence
I have to say it was incredibly easy
to get this thing
this thing started
I plugged it in
went to the website
downloaded the needed software
had it
it registered
I have to say this
I love this pad
it kind of feels like
I 'm transitioning from sketching to
sketching to digital art
I think the only touchy-feely thing I did n't care

do n't get discouraged
I 'm brushing up my drawing skills to convince
my drawing skills to convince myself that I
I deserve a tablet this good
Some people complain that it
it 's too small
you 're drawing on a computer

the ability to zoom in
depending on whether you
you 're drawing broad strokes

The pen takes a little getting used to if
a little getting used to if you 've never drawn
you 've never drawn on a tablet before
it 'll feel like you 're drawing

I do n't mind the lack of an eraser end
It 's quicker to assign one
to assign one of the two buttons on
your pen to switch to eraser mode
saving you the need to flip the pen
the need to flip the pen around

You connect the tablet to your computer

I 've seen how integrated Wacom is
I figured why
give it a try
I did n't know how much I would care
I would care for it
did n't want to shovel out a few hundreds on a risk
I went with this model
dragging a mouse around the screen
these tablets work more like a touchscreen

it shows up on the screen
I got use to the feel

you can directly see what you

I LOVE this tablet

to hold and such
The pen pressure stylus and everything works perfectly

a short learning-curve to get used to drawing on

This drawing pad has everything you need to make
you need to make a really great computer drawing
excellent software to go with it
comes with a box that makes
that makes a great storage container for when
it 's
to learn how to use
to use also
that makes this tablet kind of a pain
It 's pretty confusing
you go to register it
try and find the free software that comes with
that comes with it
there 's nothing about the tablet
that does n't make it awesome
I expected better programs
I expected
she loves all of the options
WindowsThe tablet does take a little time to adjust
a little time to adjust to
it works very well
you turn the touch sensitivity off you
you can rest your hand right on the pad
the pad making for easy drawing/writing
using the pen
the lines come out very fluid and smooth
The tablet blows my touch screen laptop out of
drawing with pencil and paper
Buttons seem easy to program with
to program with shortcuts
Some said they had problems
they had problems with their CD and verification code
I found everything to run
everything to run smoothly
all worked on the first try
running in 10-20 minutes after updating
updating the drivers
I have to say is that the "free software " bundle
you do not get a real copy of the software
I planned to use Photoshop for most of
it will take some time for her
her to learn all the in and outs
She likes it
will say to those who like to have
who like to have space to work choose the medium size version
space to work choose the medium size version it will help
it will help you a lot
I have had several tablets in the last few years
This thing rocks
Do n't let the slight learning curve discourage you.A couple times I
the slight learning curve discourage you.A couple times I thought
I thought to myself
I do n't know how much better thing thing is compared to
it felt like I had to strain
I had to strain my hand just to not even draw
just to not even draw that far across the screen
Turns out I just needed to fine
needed to fine to the settings to my liking
I ended up turning the pen acceleration all the way
I like my mouse
I did n't think I could on
I could on the second day of
I find myself using my mouse
myself using my mouse to toggle
my mouse to toggle settings
navigate extensive menu settings
who wanted to get into digital art
I have used the Bamboo Capture
believe that the Wacom Intuos Art Pen tablet is a great introduction
one will never want to use a mouse again
a 5/5
I expect for the price
to use and setup
I read a few negative reviews causing me
a few negative reviews causing me to hesitate on
me to hesitate on making
making the purchase
decided to take the chance
Meaning no offense to the reviewers
problems registering the product
the product felt 'cheap

there 's
you can do
I have n't had any experience with Wacom
I experienced precisely none
may have more experience than some
suspect that user error had quite a bit
user error had quite a bit to do with
quite a bit to do with this
install the driver and software BEFORE you connect
you connect the device
to prevent your OS from trying to automatically do it
trying to automatically do it for you
Wacom writes it 's
it 's own drivers
they do work
took about 30 seconds
making a new account
this sucker fails on me in
this review might change a bit
I have high hopes
to install
I love it
I draw and edit graphics with this
I can use it as a touchpad
the pen tablet functions do n't even work with it
that 's
I bought it

It 's smooth
Steel Series to make a mouse was

the previous 15-button version had buttons that
to use
's fingers stretch that far
we got in version 2 was
had a lot of extra buttons that
integrate into the Warcraft interface control panel
I utilize every button
Compared to the many others I
I 've tried
I give this one a 5 star
I 'm using this mouse since aboout a month
I thibk it really is
used so far.The extra button placements
you have medium sized hands like me
I bought the cataclysm mouse first
I had do gift it to
who has big hands
it 's almost as good as
used .It is definitely worth the money
I spent
I must also say that Amazon was
to send it to Turkey from
I bought this mouse
would recommend it to anyone
I 've bought
I got it strictly for
playing MMO 's
I love the extra buttons it comes
it comes with

it 's cost
I have to buy it myself
do n't get reimbursed
I do n't have to buy wrist braces

either.The wireless one came apart where the joystick meets
the joystick meets the base
I expect this one to do
this one to do that as well
works
I 'll fix the broken one
trade them out again when

They 're also surprisingly hard
to reprogram
you dont wanna reprogram the keyboard ( mouse reprograms with X-mouse fine )

I would not recommend this product
having said this
I posted this negative review on Amazon
I received an email from them
them saying they were sorry
offered to send me a new keyboard and mouse

It turned my opinion around 180 degrees
I had been struggling with a low quality keyboard for
finally broke down
did a little research

to set up
the connection light flickers ( two different ways ) when
you put the CAPS on or off
I 'm thinking of buying another one
buying another one of these for
I guess that says
says it all
Use it with the tower attached
the tower attached to the tv in

I realized the USB was in
annoying that this combo uses
this combo uses one AAA

I had to sit down
figure it out so that
it out so that I
I could teach my daughter how to get
to get around from one activity to
this could have easily been solved by reading the directions
reading the directions ( for
the directions ( for an adult )
think it 's a little complex and complicated
it 's a little complex and complicated for
a little complex and complicated for a preschooler who

watch him drop his towels and duck when
him drop his towels and duck when he

This CD has helped my daughter to improve her skills
my daughter to improve her skills in how

follow instructions
you have a 4 years old kid
My old mouse died
this used one filled the gap
one filled the gap wonderfully
I have
I seemed to have lost the bottom battery cover on the one
I have
I bought another one to fix
another one to fix it
I think better that the new one
you can replace the AA batteries with rechargeable ones
you will always have a working mouse
I think the new one has them
the new one has them built
them built in
I like the idea of plugging
plugging them into a cable
intended
It runs through AA batteries rather quickly
that 's an extremely minor annoyance
Stay with the real thing I
I have found
It 's been a couple of years
still going strong
what my son needed for
my son needed for his lap top
using it
there 's no better mouse out there
been my favorite mouse
Works great and nice to have a replacement mouse
Highly recommend seller
I do n't know
Apple discontinued these
I tried the Magic Mouse
it does n't work for me
Computer experts say mice are n't going
produced
I love it
the seller shipped quickly
I would purchase from this seller again
this mouse make using my Mac Book Pro easier
Love it
I know that this mouse has received
this mouse has received a lot of hate
I love it
It 's just large enough to fit
to fit my fairly large hands
to appear sleek and sexy
I find that
taking less than a minute
to make it continue to function good as
it continue to function good as new
I appreciate the lack of the blinding red laser
has those wonderful " touch " features
having cramps after a few hours of
having no wire to run from the left side
no wire to run from the left side of
movement reseats the batteries
do dig my new ( slightly used ) Apple Mighty Mouse
I move my fingers around
tend to mess with my internet experience
gives me total control
working all day in Illustrator and Photoshop
The track ball gets gunked up sometimes
you can use one of those screen cleaners
ungunk it
I 've always been able to use
to use Apple mouses
found two-button PC mouses
to use
turning off the functions of the Mighty mouse
I can use it
Apple came out with the Magic mouse
I ca n't use touch screen computers at all
to buy Mighty mouses when mine wear
mine wear out
I could n’t find any new ones in stores
found a used one in great condition
I bought a wired one
I 've been a iMac user for several years
I can use comfortably
The side buttons allow me to switch programs and windows
me to switch programs and windows with ease
the middle button allows me to access my apps and widgets
me to access my apps and widgets very quickly
why not buy used
I 've had my mac for 7 years
the original mouse has just begun to wear down
you take care of them
I would recomend it to all
Apple has discontinued this model
I love
I hope that they come
they come out with a replacement
I like as much
I do a lot of simple drawing
it gets the work
the work done
You can configure the mouse easily
I do n't have any need for the side buttons
I should use it for something
Glad i bought this cause it worked
it worked perfectly
Have had wireless mouses

I just picked up my new Mac Mini I
I had to have it
Connected the mighty mouse with NO problem
I do not have to give up a USB port
I love this mouse better than
I 've ever used I hope
I hope that
Apple makes something just like
It 's working well after we
we learned how
to "discover
Guest
I could not figure out how to set
to set up the wireless mouse I
I had just bought
I contacted them
they answered my questions
helped me almost immediately
I 've ever had
I 've paired it with the wireless keyboard
now have lots of options for
positioning my hands and arms while
typing
I discovered that this particular model of
to find anymore
that does not require any USB receiver
It takes 2 AA batteries is
The scrolling works a smidge different than
that requires a lot of getting
getting use too
This blows
they 've discontinued the mighty mouse
I love this mouse
highly recommend it
that show all open apps running in
all open apps running in the background
I have not seen such great dedication to their customers
I came with a complaint about
the mouse acted

I purchased this older bluetooth mouse to use on
this older bluetooth mouse to use on my new iMac.
I prefer this mouse over the Magic Mouse
I have much better control over it
The mouse came packaged like new
I feel this mouse should be an option
every new iMac given the potentially erratic performance of the magic mouse
which seems to me to be
I have tried quite a few mice
does not hurt my wrist
I prefer this to Apple magic mouse.The only mouse
that come close is
I use this with my Dell XPS
I downloaded a driver for Apple Magic mouse
Check the Magic mouse questions

I did n't even need any of those things
I put the batteries in
my powerbook found the mouse via bluetooth and I

A must have for anyone using
anyone using a laptop that gets annoyed using
that gets annoyed using the trackpad
It has a slight learning curve
you get the hang of it
Have used for over a year with our MacBook
right-click ( 'course other mice will do
other mice will do that )
the MM will access a lot of features
can use one or two batteries
using it for the past year
comparing it to other mice we
we 've had
I 'd say it was worth
it came in black to match
to match the MacBook
super quick i should of bought one of thees
i still use the keyboard because of the nice shortcut keys bur
the nice shortcut keys bur the mouse does n't compare to
the mouse does n't compare to the mighty mouse

Installed effortlessly

seeing that this only had four stars
this only had four stars I had to jump
I had to jump in to try to boost
to try to boost it
it up
do n't think I am just your everyday instant message
you will ever need
You wont have to worry about that 3 foot requirement that
most other wireless mouses stick to. Buttons
it tells if I am clicking
right or left even though its all one piece
to scroll vertically or horizontally
works as a great button for something
I chose it to be a hotkey
You can also use the scroll wheel in conjunction
out.Side Buttons
They take some getting use to because
you have probably never experienced them before
I set mine to the expose feature
We have
been there when we are trying to replace
can only find one ...with the Mighty Mouse
you need
It holds two
it can run on just one
you ask me .Re-connectivity
I saw some review that says
that says it takes 30 seconds
it takes 30 seconds for it
it to reconnect when you break

The MX5xx and G400x series have "notchy
"resistance
it makes it easier to control
to control scrolling speed
it has been said that laser tracking
I tend to agree with
I 'd rather not have to mess around with the tracking speeds
had to adjust the speed "one click
No need to mess with Y
I could own any mouse it would be
it had perfect weigh , tracking and wheel tension
the other mice listed in price/performance
highly recommended
Took a while to get use to
a while to get use to it
I had to change the sensitivity in all my games
I have owned this mouse for over a year
the mouse fits like a glove
does do its job
it has since been replaced by a newer model the G402
It 's pretty good
It feels very durable
I tend to "rage
I would recommend

had a problem with Logitech
me forking out big money to buy
out big money to buy 3 top-of-the line gaming mice (RAT
I returned them
stuck with the logitech
It seems ridiculous
this one fits my large hands the best
has the most comfortable maneuverability
I guess sometimes simpler is
you play any FPS games like Counter Strike
play Counter Strike and precision with a sensor that
that has no predictive interpolation
has no acceleration is of key importance
I love it
You can read more information on the internet
it to find out more about
this amazing sensor.Another thing to note about this mouse are
use this mouse for hours
I have absolutely zero discomfort
It offers perfect location and support for my pinky and thumb
gamers and Logitech took in feedback from
its previous generation gaming mice to offer perfect comfort.In addition
this mouse looks very durable
no questions asked
you do n't pull it on the wire
it should last a long time .5 STARS !
I 've always been a big fan of this product line

you 're a hardcore FPS gamer
Love the color

had to get used to it after my old mouse
My last one lasted about 6 years
I owned a MX510 and Mx518
reading some reviews saying this is
some reviews saying this is the remake
shipping took 6 days
I think someone rode their bike
someone rode their bike to my house lol
I 've ever owned
I 'm a avid if not more gamer
This mouse performs flawlessly
I use a Glock Armorers mat as my mousepad
it worked fine with my old Logitech
I had for about 8 years
mouse continued to perform excellently
I noticed the tracking was just a little bit
playing FPS games so I
I went ahead
decided to upgrade to this mouse
you 'd expect from a logitech product
I play :World of Warcraft ( 2200 arena
you want for a mouse without
that sits really well in a ( right
do n't use the extra buttons on it
I upgraded from an old MX 518
which had a very similar form factor
is marketed as a gaming mouse I
I use it 90 % of
I 've always used gaming mice for productivity
I find their main features ( precision
you find on a general office mouse
which has become more important to me
to me recently is
I own eventually succumb to the dreaded double click syndrome on
you 've ever experienced this you 'll understand how frustrating
this you 'll understand how frustrating this
I 'm extremely happy to see that Logitech
to see that Logitech moved from 8 million click main switches
that Logitech moved from 8 million click main switches to
increasing the switch durability 2.5x and hopefully increasing
2.5x and hopefully increasing the lifespan of my mouse
which lasted me a good 10 years
you need a mouse for your gaming needs
there 's no way you can go
you can go wrong with this one
I have ever owned
I would definitely buy this mouse again
advertized
the best mouse i ever owned
lets down
they stopped selling these
think if I bought 1 billion dollars
I bought 1 billion dollars worth of
Logitech STILL would not give decent customer/technical support
I bought 1 trillion dollars worth of
would not give a good wadsham
They could not give a duck if you
you paid them trillions
Giving a damn cannot
do
you do
Logitech does not give a flying duck
Few do
My husband loves this
He 's a gamer
we had
I bought a second one to use at

Would recommend to any serious FPS gamer.EDITunfortunately after a few days
the left click started to stick :( i switched
i switched yet again to a SteelSeries Rival
i think this may acutally be
I think the hardware is a little
they discontinued the MX518 because it
It feels just like my old MX518
that does n't bother me at all
I will probably never purchase another mouse
this one goes bad
I 'll buy another.Fits my hands perfectly
it 's the most responsive mouse I
I 've had
I used a MX518 for a very long time
felt "right
The G400 feels great
Improved on the MX518 by having
having a more textured feel instead of the slick texture
have the MX518 gaming mouse but Logitech sucks
the MX518 gaming mouse but Logitech sucks now
does n't make that mouse so I 'm stuck
I 'm stuck with this one

That sucks
They wo n't fix them either
Ordered this 3 days ago

I can use for PC gaming

it 's gone ever since
I need a new mouse I buy
I buy whatever is the newest iteration
you liked any of the previous generations
you 'll probably like this one too
I do. There is one way
they 've gone backwards though
the G5 version Logitech dropped the side scrolling feature of the scroll wheel
I found that feature extremely useful for
using it for strafing movement
I 'd buy a brand new G5 over
I like the G400S best
my old worn out mx518
I have been using Logitech gaming mice for over 10 years
will continue to do so
owned
it had a badly made cord
It 's almost exactly the same

the left-click button feels increasingly stiff
the button bumping against the larger body
It 's the sort of thing
that does n't (yet ) affect the function

I 'll revise/update my review depending on
my review depending on the outcome .Update 4/22/15
a long time using this mouse
I 'm happy to report that
to report that the stiffness of the buttons
the buttons has given way
It 's been very reliable
I 'm quite happy with the performance
It 's hard
to explain
I guess it 's related to
it 's related to the dual-mode scroll wheel
it "floats and tugs
you slide the mouse
distracting when you need precise control
you need precise control especially for
the dual-mode scroll wheel does n't feel as precise when
you switch between individual weapons in
an FPS game compared to the " step-by-step" wheel on
the G400s do not have the adjustable weight feature of the G500s
all other aspects feel much more like the Logitech
The scroll wheel lacks the left and right click motion
make the wheel feel

I want
It fits nicely in my hand
comfortable and easy to move .If I could add
I could add just one thing to this
I would add two buttons on the right side

Can't recommend it enough

I think my only complaint is the lame paint/designs
it feels better to me
It 's precise
started using the MX518 as a backup for
that require it
the left button has been on the fritz
kept using it
I started using it
it began to suffer intermittent connectivity
I decided to replace it with this

I recommend it to anyone
who needs a good gaming mouse
you play games like WoW or Guild Wars 2
use it to play shooters (
it to play shooters ( BF4
It has a great response time
feels extremely comfortable
I can use either a claw or palm grip without any discomfort
have the other buttons on the mice
the mice programmed
come in handy during my games
like the look and size of this mouse
Its heavy enough to where it does n't fly across
it does n't fly across the mouse pad
light enough to glide
to glide smoothly
has buttons on the mouse to increase or decrease
the mouse to increase or decrease the dpi
recommend this mouse to all gamers
I 've yet to have any problems with this mouse
Definitely would recommend
It works wonderfully
it does not look exactly like it
it does in the picture
packaged well so it arrived
it arrived without any damage
I have been a fan of Logitech
I wanted to get the g500s
I read a lot of reviews
persons heard a high-pitched electronic sound coming from
a high-pitched electronic sound coming from the mouse
I opted to get this one instead
There 's quite of a difference
which makes them good for
it features interchangeable DPI on mouse control
means there are buttons on
which allow you to increase or decrease the mouse
you to increase or decrease the mouse 's sensitivity while
playing games
surfing the web.
you play FPS games
you need to kill a target in an FPS game
an FPS game using a sniper rifle
you can reduce it 's sensitivity
it 's sensitivity for that pixel-point accuracy
I had a Logitech G300 mouse
broke down
bought this G400s
contains all the things I
I love
it 's very solid in your hand.To
your hand.To tell the truth
I 'm
I love having a serious mouse that is n't going to break
has some features that really help.For example
you have two monitors
the mouse can zoom across great distances easily
map the Home/End keys to some buttons
This allows me to jump to
me to jump to the bottom of
It does seem a little recessed
I love the entry level gaming mice from Logitech
feel
to use.Cons
The cord seems very fragile
it had that threaded material that some
the new mice have today
i got this to replace my mx518 and oh boy
this to replace my mx518 and oh boy was it
I had the DPI on my mx518
my mx518 maxed out
to slow for FPS games
that go to 4000 this things moves lighting
this things moves lighting fast
fits perfectly in my hand
It feels very durable
makes my gaming experience more enjoyable

to read lengthily pages
my husband uses it for gaming
says it every responsive
a great mouse to purchase and recommend it to anyone
I have ever had the privilege of using
I 've heard something described as
something described as "ergonomic
I would just think of it as
This mouse seems more than capable of handling
handling multiple grips
that do n't perform any better
feel any better than this one .Software is
to use and not invasive at all
others do not
I would have liked a braided cord on the G400s
a braided cord does not detract from the value of
feel that possibly
that possibly a slightly heavier duty mouse cord
That 's all there
Logitech makes the best mice .The packaging
seemed a shame to throw it
a shame to throw it away
An ease to use
accuracy settings make it all that
swapping between games
saves you a lot of time
the settings trying to change the sensitivity
Highly recommended

this mouse does everything right
Everybody has a subjective view about which
they want in their mouse buttons
there 's no arguing that the mouse tracks
My old G5 used to skip with extremely fast flicks
I cannot manage to do it with this mouse
I 'd give to the shape of
the ring finger rests
it 's simply
I rest my finger on top
to wrap their finger on the side
I ended up sanding it
it off on my G5
I may do the same in the future

I bought this a gift for my son
He does like the way the mouse

Buttons have a nice feel
DPI adjustment built in to the mouse
the mouse does n't require additional software like my razer
my razer did
I 've owned this for a few months
I have to say
I prefer it over the MX518
I have used for the past 5 years

basted on the reviews of the DeathAdder
I could n't resist ) much to my surprise
mouse felt great in the hand

I found out quickly the Mac OS support on
being thoroughly disappointed I returned the CM Storm
I returned the CM Storm as well

I 've never purchased a proper "gaming mouse "
had the attitude that all mice are
I ended up buying this because the previous mouse
I had started "mis-clicking " and "double clicking
I 've been using this mouse for only 1 day
I have to say
it 's pretty amazing.PROS- The wheel and buttons
The scroll wheel does n't "float
Rolling it up
down has distinct clicks
used until this mouse
You do n't have to press so hard that it
it throws your aim
this depends on your hand size
I can rest my palm on the mouse and everything
I can think of
I 'll update in the future if
something wears out or unexpected happens

I have had Logitech items for quite some time

this could mean a lighter and more accessible mouse which will allow
which will allow for quicker gestures in
speaking of quicker gestures

which feels really nice
The new color matches my computer station
Cannot go wrong with this one
This mouse reminds me of the MX518
that fits just right in my hand
I had tried the G500 prior to

you 're looking for a vertical mouse
I 've been using it about a month
it 's held up perfectly
switching to a vertical mouse
it feel awkward
it 's
a problem ( for me anyway
)
It 's just unfamiliar so each action
each action takes a tiny bit extra time to move your hand
a tiny bit extra time to move your hand the right way
You 're re-learning muscle memory built up

I switch back to a standard mouse
I keep both on my desk
it 's fine
there 's a lot less force on your fingertips
causes a slight loss of precision.---Does
make a difference
I 've personally felt a lot less cramping
cramping in my hand and wrist

I have big hands
I do n't know
I find my fingertips extend well
my fingertips extend well past the buttons and scroll wheel
I 'm really clicking the buttons with the middle-joint
It 's actually perfectly comfortable that
I left that base-plate extension thing on
I noticed the mouse was a little sluggish/bulky sliding
I took the base-plate off
the mouse felt much lighter
try taking that off
see if you like it
it ( it snaps on and off
it snaps on and off easily ).My only gripe about
I said my fingertips are well
they 're also well past the scroll wheel
It 's very hard for me
me to scroll with the middle of
I need to use my fingertip
I hold the mouse
I ca n't curl my finger comfortably

I have to change my hand position to get to

It 's maybe another of those slight awkward things

moving your hand more will likely lead to
will likely lead to fewer cramps

Better then expected
Purchased this tape in 2010
ran out
got another one today .Great for what it
it does
Makes your mouse glide smoothly
I end up putting it
putting it over the regular ( non-damaged ) Teflon pads on
it 's that much more smoother
Turned my cheapo plastic drawtube-type telescope focus mechanism into one as good as

the drawtube slides over

I hated the sound that the mouse

The tape provides a nearly frictionless contact between the Apple Magic Mouse
That 's great
the center section must have pulled tighter than the edges
leaving them humped
them humped up
I could n't simply cut a strip down one edge
one edge sized to match the mouse 's gliders
I had 2 'mouses '
' to cover
I tried different techniques
settled on cutting the tape to
cutting the tape to length
aligning its center with the middle of
I used my thumbnail to tuck the tape
my thumbnail to tuck the tape tightly to
trimmed away the excess all the way around
finishing with the thumbnail process again

glides nicely now
the center section does n't drag on the mouse pad
I 'll have to remove and repeat the process
to cover many , many times over
Have a mouse I
I love
it 's gliding all over the place
Love the idea of tape because
there 's enough to last a good long while
to last a good long while on the roll

It 's a well known fact that mice
It 's part of their description

To make things even worse
it did n't do it every single time
it would catch me off guard
saying 'EEEK'
it made me
me say
I bought this tape and everything has been perfect
this tape and everything has been perfect since then
to cut
wants to stretch out
make sure you cut quickly
you cut quickly with scissors
do n't pull it too much
I had to reapply some more ( because I
I did n't cut it to fit
it to fit before
a piece tore off )
I 've only used it for a couple
it 's really smooth
I wanted it
I put strips of this tape
the friction disappeared that I 'd been experiencing
I 'd been experiencing with my mouse
slides easily over the mouse pad
I can move my cursor around on
I will keep a roll of this tape
It 's amazing how
this has completely changed my MacBook Pro experience
using my Apple Magic mouse after it kept making awful scratching
it kept making awful scratching noises across my wooden table top
I prefer using a mouse rather than
I came across this mouse tape on
read a number of reviews from
Apple Magic Mouse users saying this solved
this solved the noisy and motion drag problems
I ordered this and cut some lengths
this and cut some lengths off the tape roll
stuck them to the sliders under
this mouse tape has made
It 's taken 85 % of the noise
glides across the wooden surface just as
it should
I 'm surprised Apple made a mouse
Apple made a mouse that had
that had such problems )
had to make track speed adjustments in the mouse settings as
flew across the screen
it 's perfect
got tired of my mouse sticking
I recalled a time when it
it would glide
I would do a little better in fps games
I went looking for new mouse feet
I read the reviews on this tape
decided to give it a try
I bought this to go on
this to go on the bottom of
I know it is not made for
I use it anyway
I had to overlap the tape 3 or 4 times on
my mouse slides with very little effort
enjoy the feel
have a gaming mouse pad that is designed to be
I have to replace the tape every few months
it works wonderfully
It has lasted me for at least five different rounds
other tape Ive used in the past
I have so much of it
Tape expires
I use this on my mouse feet
works great
gunk does n't stick to it as easily
Had a mouse with some pretty bad pads so
I bought this tape
Put it right over the pads
it slides better than when
Just have to see how long the tape lasts
the tape lasts , but for the price
I can replace as i hardly
had to use any
Easy to use does what
does what its meant
covering up the worn feet on the bottom
my cheapie mouse to make it smoother on
it smoother on a rough surface
It used to sort of "drag
I use mine on my wood
it glides like butter.The tape is
it being unsuitable for this purpose
You might even want a second layer depending on
a second layer depending on what you
you 're doing
to smooth things out
does n't take much tape to fix up
much tape to fix up your mouse
need for this purpose
it has a " shelf life
it will probably "go bad " before you
you use it all (
all ( for better or worse )
I 've tried
more than I 'll ever need
I 'm using this on the bottom
that has too much drag for me
I used this for a 1/4 inch thick sliding door
it allows the door to slide
the door to slide with easily
our seatbelt guides to aid with retraction speeds
Beats paying a dealership far more to have
to have this installed or dealing with
this installed or dealing with extremely slow seatbelts
excellent this works great
to work with all I can say is get
all I can say is get it you
you did
this made my mouse movement friction close to
to do more than one set so it
it will for most people
IT IS FANTASTIC !
putting spinners on your car
it makes it slide really
it slide really smoothly and really quietly
you use an Apple ' Magic Mouse '
which has a very large surface area of contact
some reason has plastic
for said area
Stick this tape to whatever flat surfaces you
you need less friction on
cut to shape with a sharp razor
Simplicity itself
wish the tape was a little bit wider
it would fully cover the top feet on my G502
makes old mice feel like
old mice feel like new
our mice glide now
I purchased this tape to bring new life
this tape to bring new life into my worn computer mouse
I put some of this tape
my mouse slid around effortlessly
works great for the first-gen Magic Mouse
I use a large unfinished butcher block countertop as my desk
adding this tape to the magic mouse 's plastic rails
's plastic rails has made a world of difference
It 's still not as silent and silky
it 's close enough to make me
to make me happy
Make those old mice feel
those old mice feel new again
new mice feel newer
I love a smooth gliding mouse
prefer a cloth mousepad
a great way to have the best of both worlds
I switched to the Mac platform last year
I decided to also try their Magic Mouse
I do n't know what it is
they make beautiful hardware in almost every respect
I have to wonder why the company that
that made the mouse mainstream ca n't seem to make
the mouse mainstream ca n't seem to make a good mouse ( puck mouse
I hated it so much that
returned it
did n't because I got
I got a great deal on an open-box one
it would scratch whatever surface I used
I used it on
carried a piece of blank paper to use
blank paper to use as a mouse pad
That said
I loved the gesture support
I stuck it
it out
I came to Amazon looking
Amazon looking for my solution
saw the fliders strips
I saw this tape
The reviews looked promising
it 's relatively cheap
I decided to give it a try
I wish I had bought the tape
I had bought the tape earlier
flies across most surfaces now
I let go while moving
moving quickly
it keeps going
Putting this tape on mouse feet does make
mouse feet does make a large difference in the gliding resistance
it 's pretty much a lifetime supply
a very good idea to get tape wider then this
using my mouse directly on my desk
scratching the surface over time
I purchased an aluminium mouse pad because I
I thought it would be
tear
it looks really cool
it 's NOT anything like my desk )
I purchased this tape
cut two short strips
attached them to the bottom of
it made a huge , positive difference
Gliding over the mouse pad is now
much more quiet.It 's
cut two short pieces of tape
applied them to the bottom of
you do n't ever see it
I 'm also going to guess that I 'll have to replace
I 'll have to replace the tape eventually
you use so little
get so much in a roll that
I ca n't imagine running out for quite a while
you want to make your mouse glide
your mouse glide smooth
the stuff to get
I expected
My several-year-old wireless mouse feels like a puck on
applying this over the mouse feet
falling off anyway
I used it to replace falling
it to replace falling off pads
you have an Apple Magic mouse
you know that
you use the mouse pad ( like
the mouse pad ( like I
I do )
It took about 5 min to apply
about 5 min to apply the tape
cut it with precisely sharp Exacto blade.The difference is
to do MANY mice with this roll
my Logitec mouse had worn to the point the mouse
I looked for alternatives
That 's when I found
I found this tape
It 's essentially single sided tape coated
sided tape coated with Teflon
I put small pieces over the old pads
it slides better than new
recommend
The tape works great
my mouse glides as if it was
I applied the tape about 1 month
I may have this roll for quite some time
to cut
order to keep the height appropriate ( if replacing
replacing OEM skates
look at how thick each are
try to keep the same difference among skates )
they 're very slick
seem to last a pretty decent amount of time before
having to redo them
applied this to my mouse
my mouse came off so I
I bought this as an inexpensive alternative to replacing
replacing it.The tape is a lot thinner
I expected
it works great
slides around like a stick of
an oiled down slip-n-slide
My mouse has never been so smooth
saved me some coin on a new mouse
It 's smooth ...exactly what
you want
It makes your mouse slide easier on
replacing old mouse feet
it wears off after som time
you will have a lot of extra tape
extra tape to replace it with .
Had a previous mouse that felt like
that felt like sandpaper
It 's quite smooth now
the other reviewers said
it 's very thin so do n't stretch
do n't stretch it out too long before
it out too long before cutting
It 's so thin that I
I could n't tell there was a plastic layer
a plastic layer covering the adhesive back
I thought I got a defect.You
I got a defect.You do n't need to cut it
a defect.You do n't need to cut it perfectly
apply over your existing feet
used with a low friction mouse pad
I needed a slick spot
Worked as intended
my sonto try on his mouse
I cut pieces of this
stick them to the bottom of
Just cut to size
This stuff makes your mouse move like butter
feels better than any stock feet
any stock feet i have ever used
replace the strips every few weeks to keep it
every few weeks to keep it fresh
Do buy the wider one if you
you have a gaming mouse with wider pads
I thought I could wing
I could wing it
getting the right width is
this product will make even a new logitech mouse better
This tape will last you forever
It 's really great
I doubt there 's a better product
there 's a better product out there
you can use it on a variety
( have already repaired 3 gaming mice
I use it for the bottom
my mouse to make it glide
it glide better
you use a metal mousepad these will make
these will make you literally slap
slap yourself for
trying them sooner
changed my life
lasts forever
making its price fairly close to free
purchased a used Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical ( great mouse btw
thus dragging a bit more than
I like
I bought this mouse tape
cut little pieces for each pad
my mouse feels brand new and glides smooth as
the teflon moves on the surface with
overlapping the tape to compensate
the tape to compensate may not work
may not work so well
you want it
it to do
renew worn out teflon pads
I cannot count the number of perfectly fine mouse devices
I 've dumped simply because the pads
drag
Renew the slide
do not expect the tape to last
the tape to last very long
You might think five yards is
It 's
It wears out pretty quickly
I guess I get about three weeks
I get about three weeks out of
it starts dragging simply apply new tape
I expect the five yards will last at least
the five yards will last at least a few years .If
do run out of this tape I
I 'll surely order another
do products perform
products perform perfectly
this one does perform perfectly
It works well so far
I had to use a layer of duck tape
It 's easy
to use
I did notice was that
Used this stuff to shim the play out
this stuff to shim the play out of
moves as smooth and accurate as a much more expensive model
made a cheap mouse move much smoother on my coffee table
I 've only used it for five minutes
I 'm always wearing the bottoms off of
Took a minute
a minute to install
it glides better than new
I wear this out I
I have like 100 years worth
I tried everything on my desk
my desk to get a mouse to glide
a mouse to glide smoothly
took the feet off of one
that worked better for a while
it 's the mouse I 'm currently using
I 'm currently using a Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse
I tried taping stuff on with
I saw this and well for whatever
I paid
it seemed worth a try
I made my own feet
a little board paper cut small pieces
placed in the center of the tape
taped them on
I went to replace it
pealed right off
it stays on
I do occasionally replace it
there 's so much of it
it takes so little
I replace the tape like every two or three months
guess it 's
it 's a con
it gets dirty easily
I 'm using it on
I have a microfiber cloth I clean it
a microfiber cloth I clean it with
I did get a new desk so I
cleaned it with Pledge Lemon wax
( did n't help with the original feet ).Basically
I love it
needs cleaning
wipe it off with
it off with a soft cloth
do n't have a problem
others noted
I do n't think it would work to replace the original pads
it would work to replace the original pads on your mouse
it should go on top of
the pads.That 's what I
I did
I put a small strip of this tape
I 'm a computer programmer
my mouse gets tons of usage
I have n't had any issues of it
it peeling off.5 yards might not sound like
off.5 yards might not sound like a lot
you 're doing is putting a little strip on
worn mouse feet to make them smoother
making movement have

makes your mouse move smoother
It does not add significant height to my mouse
It will last you a long time
does require somewhat frequent replacement ( depending on us
somewhat frequent replacement ( depending on us of

so taped up a large amount of surface area
Does n't feel very sticky on your fingers
it clings to glossy plastic very well
It did not want to stick to the rubberized coating on
do n't think any mice use that coating on
any mice use that coating on the bottom
.You 'll want to keep some tools around to pop and smooth
to pop and smooth air bubbles
I used an x-acto knife
Those tools will make sure it adheres
it adheres solidly as well
I had one complaint it would be
I should have ordered a wider tape
it would have taken half as long
I carefully cut off small pieces of this tape
placed it over the existing feet on
used an Exacto knife to cut away the excess
an Exacto knife to cut away the excess around
I placed my mouse back on
it would slide out of my hand
I had to sometimes force the mouse into the position
I wanted it
moves so smoothly it hardly takes
takes any effort at all
twirling my mouse around
this took less then 1 inch
take some to the office .Very much
recommended
Put it under your mouse
have a antifriction mouse mat
it works
it glides beautifully
you need it to apply on
it to apply on the existing mouse feet
to last a long time
to cover worn-down plastic mouse feet
other posters suggested
it will NOT work as replacement mouse feet
it did cover my existing ones well .)
I have now found other surfaces that need
that need extra slip
used it there
we slide our keurig machine out most days
now it glides across my counter...)Color
it glides across my counter...)Color did not matter

I 'd say it 's
it 's much more gray
I 've used it on 5 mice

about 17 feet left.The adhesive holds tightly
to squeeze out any air bubbles
I do n't have a rough mouse pad to test out
a rough mouse pad to test out how long the tape
the tape will last with it
it will definitely last a long time with a smooth , non-textured pad
other reviews have stated this stuff is
mouse pad replacement.Works better than the original pads
there 's enough material provided to last
enough material provided to last me
to last me forever
my mouse had let go long ago
I fought it for a long time
gluing them back on
I bought PTFE feet off of
The PTFE tape works great as a solution
that has held up much better than the cheap feet
to remove friction with my cloth mouse pad
applying about 6 layers
to go
I cut with a razor knife around
I applied one more over-sized layer
cut it over-sized
to prevent an edge from being caught by
being caught by the mouse pad
it 's round
wo n't get peeled back over time
I 've used this with a Logitech G500
it seems like it floats
it floats over the pad
the product arrived on timeit was
I 'm satisfied
will reorder it the next time
I use this on my Logitech
the feet began wearing away
A small amount applied to each mouse foot will bring
each mouse foot will bring back the gliding feel and responsiveness as
used your mouse
others may have read elsewhere
the feet does need replaced about once every week to
put a piece of tape over
glide smoothly over the pads
You get a lot of tape
it 's very cost-effective
The CS Hyde PTFE Mouse Tape make my mouse glide across the mouse pad
works as good as it did
it did when it was
to quickly react to gunfire in FPS
They allow you to keep a low sensitivity
you to keep a low sensitivity which the pros
the pros use
Worked perfect on my ageing Logitech G5
to cut it to the shape of
the pads .Restored that missing glide
missing glide from when it
this goes a long way
I needed about 4 inches worth to replace
to replace the PTFE feet on my mouse
I 've got plenty
plenty to spare
the mouse glides so nice now
Used this to refresh the feet on
this to refresh the feet on a 6 year old gaming mouse
I 'd like on my mousepad which
covered up all the mice in the household
all people say that
they glide
new.This one roll will probably last for years unless
I find some other uses for it
I threw this tape on my magic mouse
using it on the magic mouse
Others have said this is
concur
Thank you CS Hyde
I used this tape for the runner-slots
It adhered well
made the door much easier
much easier to open
I put it on all my mice
It 's cheap
to tape at least 100 mice if not more
My mouse feels much smoother
a joy to use now
noticed her mouse was
This will also get rid of any scratch noise
your mouse might make when in use
The feet needed teflon
It took about 5 minutes to tape
about 5 minutes to tape the little feet
trim them up with
them up with an exacto knife
start using the mouse again
have a lot of hope here but wow
I have a RAT 7 mouse which was worn
This tape saves me
I run out of this tape ....hope
I WILL buy more
tape may roll up at edges of
Trim it
Tape may wear out if there
you missed
applying
Guess what
peel it
put on some more
What else do you
you want
Can't beat this
it looks like a REALLY thin roll
it makes sense
it 's teflon tape for your mouse feet
you use it
mouse feet started dragging worse than a kid
I got it
I checked with Logitech
they do not sell replacement feet for this model
Logigech offered to replace or fix the mouse under warranty
I did n't want to pay for shipping it
shipping it back
waiting God only how long to get
to get it back only to have
to have the feet start dragging again so
the feet start dragging again so I
I decided to try this mouse tape.The tape is
that makes it easier for
the tape to conform to an uneven surface
Being the lazy old broad I
I did n't even bother to cut the tape to the exact shape
the two mice printed on top of
approximated the outside curve of the feet
let the inside edge hang over the feet
the inside edge hang over the feet onto
I mentioned
the thin tape conformed very well to the feet
the mouse moved over the pad
the tape will last since it
I do have to replace it every two or three months
the roll to last for a couple of
shipping the mouse back to Logitech
Logitech would have cost me
I 'm going to get ambitious
put this tape on the rest of
).Post edit
got ambitious
put the tape on the feet of
I went to the trouble of
trimming around the edges with a single edge razor blade
The results look good
I used only a foot of tape
tape to cover the feet on three meeces
I left a slight overhang on the end
only untouched adhesive would touch each foot itself
doing four mice
have roughly 13 1/2 feet left.Post post edit
I 've since found that CS Hyde makes
CS Hyde makes a 1" wide PTFE tape that is
much easier to apply than the 1/2
It works every bit as well as
should last longer before wearing
wearing out
I do n't even bother to pretrim the tape
cut some off that is
holding the tape by the side
I apply it to each foot
trim the tape that overhangs the side
I do n't even bother to trim around the foot anymore
no one will ever see it
I have applied it to my expensive laser gaming mouse
used in conjunction with a nice mouse surface
I would highly recommend at least keeping one of these around
you need
you could almost use this tape for an entire lifetime
addressing mouse feet issues
works for anything you need to slide
you need to slide around surfaces , not
having bought 5 mouse from different manufactures
reading about how to keep them
to keep them in great condition from
I came across this tape which
which lead me to the CS Hyde website [
it seems as of recently their mouse products page
being integrated with their industrial page
I bought the teflon dots
Having just received my tape today I decide time
I decide time to say
time to say something
I will never not use teflon material again
gliding across the pads and accuracy is not affected in
I mean what was I
I thinking before
you do is
game all day
you do
need that extra precision
invested in a great mouse and pad
protect that investment with tape

I see wear I will try
I will try the tape out next
it will cover the feet completely ( depending on
the feet completely ( depending on what mouse you
you have

you 'll notice the dots
dots suit you

the price goes down the more you order which
I ordered 100 of each size .A friend
each size .A friend asked about mouse pads
I told him what I
I owned
he felt they
I sent the CS Hyde link
he found the pad that
he wanted
bought it that same day
me its great
I ca n't comment on that other
my friend likes the pad
making a great product.Leah who took my order

All computer nerds will love it as you
you get a giant roll so that
you can cover up your mouse feet for
I 'm
what else to tell you except it
it comes in a roll
has adhesive on the back
remember it
it 's
It 's best to just put it
to just put it over the existing pad
you could just cover the bottom of the mouse
Just remember to keep the laser or mouse ball free
it touches itself adhesive to
cut it off
start over.All in all a great product
to do 20-30 mice easily
Purchased this tape to extend the life of
this tape to extend the life of my Microsoft Sidewinder Mouse ( 5 button USB ) mouse
The tape works great
It allows the mouse to slide as
the mouse to slide as it did
it did when I first
purchased it
Worked so well I also use
use it for my mouse at
this tape lasts ( at least for me
I find other uses for it.Pros-Fixed my sidewinder mouse
it did when new.-Tape is
it would pull off
snag
It has not once.-Very
easy solution to prolong the life of your mouse.Cons-This size tape
your mouse.Cons-This size tape did n't cover my mouse feet exactly
The wider tape would work better I think as
think as this tape does not stick to
this tape does not stick to itself so
you ca n't just cut another piece
you know what
what to expect
It does not add any thickness to the surface
you can not 'add ' other points of contact
raise your mouse feet if other parts of
you remove the original pads it will allow
it will allow other parts of the mouse
the mouse to touch
I bought this to use on
this to use on the bottom of
drawers to reduce the friction when sliding
sliding them in and out
it works great
I used this to cover the skids
this to cover the skids on a Magic Mouse
a Magic Mouse to use with the SteelSeries Experience glass mouse pad
the mouse scraped very loudly and uncomfortably
it glides beautifully and more quietly ( though still
some sound to remain )
The tape thickness seems perfect
to work with
it does n't bunch up when you are applying
it stays put quite well
Highly recommended
I bought this CS Hyde PTFE tape because I
I LOVE this mouse
it 's the best one I
I 've ever had
I want to make sure I can keep using
I can keep using it for many years
Teflon ) tape to go over the mouse feet
reading the documentation for this tape and
I decided to buy both products
I did
I think these two things together are
mouse feet wearing down AND for
mouse pads wearing out
my Razer pad had become so worn from friction with
had that nice slippery coating
I have found that this size of
to cut it a bit longer than
smooth the ends of the tape over
rubberized sides of the mouse
it takes about 4 inches of tape
tape to cover the mouse feet completely
enough tape to cover the mouse feet 45 times
to last for years to come .Then
years to come .Then I cut
I cut the 16 " x 16
placed one of those on
the CS Hyde pad has a tacky , sticky feel to it
grips the Razer nicely
I think it is best used as
a replacement covering for an existing mouse pad
It serves the same purpose for your mouse pad
the tape does for your mouse
VERY pleased with my purchase of
being extremely well suited to their purpose
I do think you should buy both products
you should buy both products because I
I think the PTFE coating on the tape
the tape might wear out too fast otherwise
it 's still a bargain considering
a bargain considering how much you get
you get for the price
I want to counter the review saying this
the review saying this is
I put pieces of duct tape
the tape made the mouse non-functional on
to do it 's job without
it 's job without interfering
interfering with the tracking of my mouse
any mouse .It works well too
putting it on your mouse it
it 's good to oversize it
to oversize it a little
It will stick better to the plastic
it 's super low-friction
do n't overlap pieces.If you have
you have an Icemat/steelseries experience mouse pad
These do an equally good job on my Icemat
I do n't know why they thought
they thought the two minor lights on this needed
it 's a nice mouse that works
that works well
Loving this mouse
it 's an excellent move from my older Logitech
Profiles make switching context easier
Grip feels really great in hand
I can see this improved is to move
to move the lower index finger button to the side of
it 's too easy to accidentally hit trying to hit
to accidentally hit trying to hit the upper index finger button
It has been a great gaming mouse
I have had
I have tried cordless and corded
this one has preformed the best.
I have ever seen
have more buttons or options
I really doubt anyone
anyone could really benefit
This mouse has buttons everywhere you
you can reach
has a mode button so you
you can define different modes
select them with a button under
It comes with weights that
you can insert underneath to help tune the weight and balance
to help tune the weight and balance of the mouse
make it perfect for you
I have to admit
I moved the weights around
I cannot feel a different with or without them
they offer some difference
ca n't feel it
I changes the FPS of the mouse
it can go from super sluggish to
you ca n't use it
I have the speed set
the speed set a little slower
I can accurate click on things
speed it up
it up a bit
I speed it up too much
it up too much I
I cannot aim
has a couple LEDs on it that
you can change
I have it match the color scheme of my keyboard
my computer looks more like a piece
you want a good solid mouse for FPS shooters
You can assign so many options to your mouse
you wo n't need the keyboard as much
you can setup different modes for the game
you can make unique modes for all your games
the mouse will automatically adopt these modes when the game
the game starts
the game has different modes
exploring you might want to have different settings within
you might want to have different settings within the game
the mouse software lets you do
you do that
you can switch between the modes
you can set a single mode that is
you hold down a special button
I slow the mouse way down
I pull up the scope on
I can click this button to slow my movements
this button to slow my movements way down
help me
me aim
I release the button it goes
it goes back to the setting
I do n't have any complaints about this mouse
I could have imagined
it can support
you can use it as a standard 3 button wheel mouse
ignoring the rest of the features
it works fine
you can start adding functionality as needed
It does n't require you to learn its capabilities
you to learn its capabilities to use it
its capabilities to use it out of
I ca n't really think of anything else
I would want
i 'll use olny this mouse
Would n't recommend if you
you 're an MMO player
limit button count
ive waited 5 months before making
making a review to test if it
a review to test if it was
feels like new highly recomend

OMG the scroll wheel
You know on Overwatch when

THIS IS TOO FAST
that 's what it 's
it 's like when you

You 're suddenly Tracer zooming
Tracer zooming up and down so fast
no having to turn it upside down
to unlock/lock it
i have the Sniper button as my Play/Pause button
I need another

I love this mouse
I have the Corsair equivalent
the construction does n't feel quit as good the performance
Got it to replace
it to replace my old Logitech
feels like a perfect replacement except the sensitivity
the buttons felt weird at
my aging ( and malfunctioning ) G9 (
it does n't have the interchangeable grips of the G9
it fits my hand quite well
I tend to rest my whole palm on the mouse
the claw grip reveals
should work well
love it 's
it 's size and weight
it 's also very customisable which
love this mouse
Nothing negative to say about the hardware
the software could use some work
it does n't detect the game process if it
it launches from Steam
nothing to do with the mouse
it gets 5 stars
I have purchased this mouse 2 times
it 's the best gaming mouse I
I have ever used
It 's lighter
comes with weights incase you want to install
you want to install them in it
The mouse works great with the Logitech gaming software
you can change between 3 lvls of
Love the feel
did n't have the extra grip you sometimes want
want with FPS games
all i need to say
I have ever used
you can do on a computer
which took me about a week
a week to get used
to .
I say this loosely ) is the braiding
that encases the cord
starts bunching up
frays ( I previously owned
owned the predecessor to this mouse
the braiding did the exact same thing )
Love it
I play Overwatch
had most of the abilities on
expected
the ability to fine tune this mouse with weight and motion
you can map the buttons to Resolve
the buttons to Resolve commands
I play CS:GO
use a LOT of mouse buttons
missclick any of them
I think it is not recommended for
to use
I have ever owned

I would recommend it to anyone
I love the feel of it
Love it
better gear compare to steelseries
I been a gamer for about 20 years

I use all weight except for
Make sure you download logitchs software
you download logitchs software so you
you can fully customize the buttons
Logitech thought this one though while
designing this one
All buttons have a clean , audible tactile response which is
to press
who can really fine tune the mouse to their liking
you can activate the infinity scroll
do n't like
some do )
The ability to customize your DPI presets is
to work with
spending a little time with it
you can figure it out
it out relatively easily
a good feature to have
has 2 styles ( breathing and color shift ).All in all this
Would recommend this mouse to anyone who
who uses a desktop
my Logitech G9X started dying after 6 years of

my G9X came back to life
a more awesome RGB set up

It has 4 buttons on top

It has a scrollwheel that can also tilt

you can kinda "unlock
it can scroll up/down pretty fast
keep it locked so it
it locked so it behaves
it behaves like a regular scrollwheel
There 's also a DPI button

relying on a keyboard for a good 90 %
this has made my life so much more comfortable that
it 's almost a crime .The

you prefer a lighter one
you can do
I like it
You can switch the LED to whatever
you want
You can turn it

you can also change on the fly
giving you even more functions

I think it 's slightly confusing at
it 's slightly confusing at first
it 's really easy
to use and configure
it looks like some kind of
a turn off for some
this mouse do n't know what else
what else to say
I purchased the G502 as a replacement
that wore out
listening to how loud the G402 's middle wheel click sound
I did
It does look a bit like the Batmobile
to reach
I did n't buy for the lighting
that may appeal to some
coming from the G400...trust me
it 's fine
It does n't bother me either.As with
I have one configuration
I have another

They have always been my favorites to use for
my favorites to use for both gaming and everyday use
this one continues the tradition
being the only mouse I 've tested that
I 've tested that was worthy
to replace my G500s. I especially liked
liked that the new weights
to exactly match my other hardware
use it for moba and mmorpg
it works perfectly fine
a bit confusing to use at first
it isnt bad at all
The product seems pretty durable
to use
clicks feel amazing- really accurate

I 1st bought the MMO Red Dragon mouse
I did not enjoy pressing the button on the side
Returned it

A very satisfying mouse to play WoW with
… would have been nice to see AT LESS
to see AT LESS the mouse wheel lite up

nothing bad I can say about
I can say about it
I gave this to my 19 year
he says it does everything
it does everything he needs and feels
he needs and feels better in his hand

can say that while
I love Razer products
My kiddo loves this so much I 'm buying
I 'm buying one for those times

I have with the mouse
it has a feel to it
I find
It 's my first upgrade from the cheap "gaming
you see on Amazon
the previous G502 looks much more sleek
looks better in person than
it does in pictures
the scroll wheel take the cake
I did n't get the deathadder
I can choose between clicky scroll
you give it a good flick
it 's very satisfying
feels premium
the removable weights feature because it not only allows
it not only allows you to adjust
you to adjust the weight
this mouse does not run in Linux
it does run in windows
it stores the settings inside the mouse
you select the option for it
it to do so
I 've ever used
It 's the best on the market period
I 've been very happy with the mouse and software
going strong
I take very good care of my tech
Recommend it
Nice feel in the hand
I went on a 23 player kill streak in
I started using it

it does n't have a cheap or flimsy feel
it 's another premium Logitech creation
has lighting on it that
have it cycle through different colors
it 's one of the best mice
've ever owned
i go through mice pretty frequently
I 've had a Razer Copperhead
I 've owned so far
the finishing wore off after a time
The G500 had great customization
to logitech or not
customizing DPI stopped saving

Their shapes look very different
I promise you this is

I say closest
I meant the micro-gear
the little strength needed to click
the almost nothing response time ( to take out some potential confusion
I 'm using a Razer Vaspula pad with a normal size QCK
I tested G500s
them worked
I felt a strong impulse to smash my G500s
a strong impulse to smash my G500s into pieces
I laid my hand on the just-arrived G502
It required tons of effort
effort to click from the rather bottom part
to adjust for someone with a small-mid size hand
I had to bear the 500s for a couple months ...And back
please give G502 a try
I wish you luck on
finding yours .Still
such a pity Logitech gave up on G9X
I want
I 've owned dozens of Logitech mice
it came in a wireless version. Buttons feel
a wireless version. Buttons feel solid
I used the razer deathadder for a year
buying this mouse
I wish I would of swapped to
I would of swapped to this one more quickly because
I love the ergonomics
come with it make
it make a difference
The weights make a real difference
worked flawlessly
I own the previous flagship from Logitech
I own a bunch of Razer mice
I prefer Logitech for FPS shooters
This mouse has a button that releases
that releases the mouse wheel so you
you can scroll fast
what made me want to buy this mouse
me want to buy this mouse to replace
this mouse to replace my G9X
It works very well
I expected
I 've ever had
I use a fingertip grip
it feels awesome
The many buttons do n't disturb my grip
some mentioned me earlier
Would buy a thousand times
Love it
I feel like I can keep
I can keep up with the best
I ca
I feel like it
I love the design
you can put in the bottom are
I have is that the scroll wheel
the scroll wheel seems a little looser than
I 'd like
it 's
I use to quickscope n00bs
It 's like the G502 but
Product came perfectly
Love it very adaptable to various hand sizes
hand grips love it
it comes with the adjustable weights
Does allow for custom DPI settings which is
the option to have an infinite scroll wheel is a pretty good bonus
It 's great
I love the customization buttons
love the led and buttons
Easier to game it
it 's really limited if you
you use multiple programs
to use
me to find a good feeling mouse
I use a claw grip when gaming
It fits my hand like a glove
have to adjust my hand when I reach
I reach for it
it does absolutely fine
Logitech Gaming software is
It works exactly as
you would expect
It 's what the Cue software with
Corsair should have been.The weight tuning is
I would like if the weight
it 's absolutely fine for me.All
You can even add macros to each button
You can set 5 individual levels of DPI
DPI according to your needs
You can also include a DPI shift
holding the button where your thumb
your thumb rests
to lower ( although some use it
it to heighten ) the DPI for
respectively ) mouse movement depending on your needs.The scroll wheel is
I received the product
It makes scrolling through long web pages or applications a breeze
restricting the mouse by making
making it
it " click
you can release the mouse wheel
allow it to spin
it to spin freely
You can also use it normally
you wish. The mouse itself is
not too rubberized as to promote
to promote sweaty hands
you have the money
buy this mouse
my son expected
packaged
loves this for gaming
holds up to it 's
it 's reputation
Son loves it
got it for Christmas !
I 've had love the extra weights have all but one
the extra weights have all but one in so
it 's heavier on the right buttons
Love this mouse
My wife uses it as a gift
I wanted to give her after having
having her use her old Logitech
her use her old Logitech outdated
her old Logitech outdated mouse
This works and looks the part...SOPHISTICATED
Built for that gamer in mind
came from the original g502
you can buy
he wanted
looks great
works even better
This mouse feels great
looks great
works great
I could imagine
The RGB system works flawlessly
looks great although I really
whish they had added
they had added more light sources
having 1 G symbol with a light is
it does not add much the the beauty of
I would have wanted
I have a love/hate relationship with is
I love it 's free roll feature
it 's free roll feature with a click
click it again
has no rubber what so ever
making it awkward feeling until you
you get used to it
rubber would have been nice around the scroll wheel )
goes up to 12,000 DPI
you would need that I
I have no clue
This thing has buttons galore
very well placed only finding myself accidentally here or there hitting
there hitting the dpi down switch
placed
works
you need to slow down that DPI instantly
Last thing to talk about is
claim the mouse is heavy without but i
adding more weights
G502 comes with 5 weights to tailor
5 weights to tailor this mouse perfectly to
give me more RGB lighting
I have nothing bad in
any way to say about this mouse although
Been using mice since the early 90 's
I use a mouse for laptops
laptops ) for nearly every waking hour
I 'm trying to get at is that
I have a LOT of hours
hours using many different mice
Having said that
I do recognize that everyone
everyone has their own preferences
I bought this mouse for home use
I had prior to this
gave up the ghost after 7 years
Amazing when zoomed in
you need to scroll horizontally
Looks really nice
the most positive feedback / solid clicking buttons on a mice
I 've ever used
I 've used
It feels really nice
to click
you can sometimes click far enough down to
it can trigger it several times
This being so positive
it stays secure
you can open it
to put in.
Mouse wheel clicks are
I 've used.
all seems very well
they moved one of the buttons
I 've
used
It does n't bother me
it might bother others in a group setting.
I do have an above averaged size hand
Say
I wear L gloves
This does n't really bother me
I 'd say.Cons
I had to use all of the weights
it started to feel decent.
I wish the texture on it
I can see how you might accidentally slip
you might accidentally slip in a high stress multiplayer game.
Mouse wheel clicks require a substantial more amount of effort
which can move / click easily
This one requires more effort
I 've used
it will start to move
not get past the click
roll back
I can see how it would be
I do n't really care for the plastic section that
that runs down the back of
I would prefer it to just be
It does n't serve a purpose other than

I love about this mouse is

I love how it reads

I have been using this mouse for about 4 months
a gaming mouse to use at work
I work for a tech-company of

I used the Logitech G5 a long time
remembered how
I liked that compared to
compared to the dime-a-dozen Microsoft business mouses that are lying
hours doing some comparison work
I figured it would be either
some this may appeal
The Razor mouses seem simpler
I wanted a mouse that layed
that layed nicely in my palm
moved smoothly
just felt right
I decided to go for the G502 due
I have not been disappointed
I 've actually started to use part of the customization

dpi speedCons :Took me some getting use

it 's pretty heavy .Mouse
pretty heavy .Mouse will not "feel
it 's a pretty good mouse for what
I think it would suit
it would suit most teens/adults
I 've been using wireless mice for years
I wanted to experience precision
This mouse has been great
I 've used it with the weights
I enjoyed the mouse so much
I ordered the wireless counterpart. I wo n't go
I wo n't go back to the previous wireless mouse
I had unless I
I HAVE to
I 'm very pleased with this product
I 've ever used
a steal
I 've ever used
I have 3 or 4 others
Would buy again
I 've been using the G502 as daily driver
I have to say it completely destroys
destroys any other mouse I
I have used

Use it more for normal computer use
I added the weights
Played around with for a few days
I found the configuration of weights
I preferred
Non-gamers do n't really need this wired mouse
get a wireless mouse instead
You wo n't notice a different in lag times
This mouse feels absolutely fantastic
it fit in my small lady hands comfortably
fits in my husbands big man hands comfortably
it 's definitely worth the money
you have it figured out
it figured out it 's
it 's pretty easy to tweak
to tweak the lightning
configure the buttons
that comes in handy when
you need it
itself has a very sturdy feel
I do want to mention is that the back
your palm rests ) is
do n't let that make-or-break your purchase decision
It 's a great mouse with some nice features
made
a side note the cable itself is
it 's about a 6 footer
I would definitely recommend
I use this for fps
I saw that it was
I went for the purchase
It 's extremely comfortable
to use
the ability to program the buttons to various functions
I 've noticed is that when
starting up the computer it sometimes
takes a few seconds for the Logitech software to
the mouse behaves like it 's
it 's on its default settings
lasts a second or two
I could probably get rid of that
changing the priority of the startup process .Overall
would definitely purchase it again
I got it when I
I saw the bf discount
I think the keys on the side
you like me cs go enthusiast
me cs go enthusiast do not get
do not get any other mouse key
Extremely customizable , fits well in my hands
i know what to do with
what to do with .Set the leds
it looks great on my desk
the best mouse i 've ever owned .Will update if issues
issues arrise
I 've used so far
I 've gone though 5
Put the full weights in
super smooth and comfortable to use
I find that I forget
I forget I have all the extra buttons
I have all the extra buttons on this thing
do n't really use them much
the option to click a button for intended vs smooth scrolling
Has a nice long braided cable
I 've not had any issues with it
I find the right and left click to have
the right and left click to have just the right sensitivity
to loose
I have n't had nearly as many accidental clicks
I had with my old Logitech G5
I 've ever owned
Had a previous Logitech mouse which was great
this one to replace it
It 's smaller than
I thought
I had
I did not like
page down side buttons are too close
playing games
I have to learn to have my thumb rested lower
my thumb rested lower than I
it will work
I have to make sure open the Logitech software on
it 's totally reasonable for that
that to happen
I assume this is just
you 'll ever need
feels great
you may not think is
to keep it at the perfect weight
Have a great feel
this mouse feels great
I can easily place the base of my palm
still hit almost all the buttons extremely easily
I have not found very useful
Hard to hit
2. Fairly useless
you would use when sniping
your sensitivity when scoped in
That being said
you can fairly easily reassign it to a different function
hitting still I find quite hard.Other hardware
I find quite hard.Other hardware notes:-The scroll wheel is
to accidently to hit the toggle in-game which can cause you
which can cause you to switch weapons
you to switch weapons when you
to get out of mouse after
you put them in-The texturing on
the rubber feels really comfortable
I have used it four hours with
getting uncomfortable.-Ergonomics
feel greatThe software
it has some things that are
to do that would be nice if
Adjusting the Dpi can be kind of
looking
That sounds dumb
to not make the colors so vibrant without losing
losing brightness
have pretty much any in-game function you could want without
you could want without having to go
having to go in
change controls in-game
this means that if you
you switch to the onboard profiles
forget
to pressing
you expect them
just make sure you
you check
make sure you are set to
profile .Final Thoughts / TLDR: I highly recommend
recommend this mouse
has no glaring issues
to customize
you should definitely buy this mouse if you
I bought this to replace
this to replace my
works
wanted a new one
it looks cooler
easier to reach and use than the G500

the software lets you change the dpi buttons to
the dpi buttons to something more useful
recommend this mouse
feels great
Looks good with Logitech rgb keyboard and rgb headphones
I found out about only
the mouse wheel has two different modes
the wheel to rotate freely and therefore spins as if
it 's lubed up sort of like
like spinning a coin
The second mode enables a " stopper
sort to allow the mouse wheel to only go 2 or 3 clicks
the mouse wheel to only go 2 or 3 clicks at a time
you having to use your finger to scroll it
your finger to scroll it again unlike
I do n't really use it that much
fits my build
expected no complaints
I 've come across
all goes as planned I 'll not need a new one
I 'll not need a new one for the next half-decade
I bought this an a G900 wireless/wired at
this an a G900 wireless/wired at the same time
The G900 started to randomly disconnect from motherboard after
would n't connect
This G502 works great
I expect from Logitech
I passed up on this mouse
thinking it was just another edgy
just another edgy looking "gamer mouse
could tell this design
I 've ever used
I can hit all 5 buttons without strain
I 've used a lot of multi-button mice
I 've never had one
had one where I can reach
I can reach all of the buttons
The software provides a lot of customization/profile management
allows the changes to be saved
that bothers me is I
I cannot get the same lighting pattern as my logitech keyboard
like how you can program buttons
you can program buttons to perform certain functions and store
buttons to perform certain functions and store the profiles to

I have ever purchased
You can even program macros

I opted to upgrade to the G502 and load
This has helped quite a bit
I enjoy the G502 every bit as much
I did the old MX518
Would buy again in a heartbeat
I have ever had
It fits very well in your hand

the g502 makes for a good gaming mouse
I use it for League of:Legends
I 've noticed that my clicks
take this witha grain of salt since
I 'm coming from a 2000 's dell mouse
I 've yet to really dig into the feature
I purchased this mouse after using
using a Razer DeathAdder Chroma for about a year
I had a Logitech G5 for
many years ( my favorite mouse of all time
all time )
The Razer scroll wheel stopped working less than a year
I decided to go back to Logitech
the mouse looks strange when looking
looking at it
I decided to give it a try as
I had great experience with logitech
the mouse fits my hand very well
to use
customizability using the logitech software
love the weights as I can adjust
I can adjust the weight of it
it to how I like
I like it for gaming
I 've used since the G5 I
I had
I 've been using a Razer deathadder for the last two years
I 'd used a non-Logitech mouse for gaming
I 've used from Logitech
I 've been really impressed
gimmicks turned out to make
to make a real difference
changes how the mouse handles
I preferred placing two weights in the slots
I tend to use a more relaxed claw grip
the weights gave the mouse a nice heft
felt good moving side to side
did n't expect to use the sniper button ...turns out that
the sniper button ...turns out that being
being able to drop my DPI on
to drop my DPI on the fly greater
improved my accuracy for certain moments in
being able to switch from a 2400DPI MOBA profile
to switch from a 2400DPI MOBA profile to a 1600/800 DPI shooter profile
play around with
The button placement takes some getting used to
some getting used to as there
my giners knew what to do
what to do with
that let you cycle
you cycle DPI settings
I 'm adjusting though
I felt like my accuracy improved
my accuracy improved with this mouse
I do n't know if that is
I 'm excited to continue to experiment with
I 'm really glad I
I bought this mouse
I wo n't miss the Deathadder at all (
THIS IS A STEAL FOR SUCH
I love this mouse
been using since it
it 's brother Logitech G502 Proteus Core
decided to upgrade because of the RGB features
who play with low sensitivity
Coming from a G500 I had
I had high expectations
to say this mouse exceeded all of
this mouse exceeded all of my expectations
The weights adds a great tactile feel
prevents me from throwing my mouse
throwing my mouse around
you dial in your DPI settings switching
your DPI settings switching them on the fly
This works great when you
you need to switch from a low DPI to
high such as going from sniping to
sniping to flying a plane .One
flying a plane .One potential issue
to bring it down a star is
I think this would be better more rounded and ergonomic
Product arrived quickly
It works great
The mouse looks great
Compared with my previous M705 which
this mouse has a more accurate positioning
which allows to move the cursor across the entire 34-inch screen
I have to install a new mouse control program
I love this mouse
that helps me keep track of which
I 'm on
I 've always ended up uncertain of the profile
I 'm on on my previous logitech mouse
enjoy the high DPI
you can have 4 speed settings to change between
4 speed settings to change between quickly
considering my hands are
I wish this model came with
this model came with the wings on
both sides to prevent my pinkie finger from dragging
I 'm getting used to it
Logitech gaming software has a very user friendly UI
to use
I had trouble getting it
trouble getting it to recognize

you have this problem
run it as administrator
I would recommend this
I paid full price )
I wish I had waited a few weeks
I had waited a few weeks to buy
a few weeks to buy this
needed a new mouse desperately
This replaced my old Microsoft Intelli-mouse
I liked how they added
they added RGB lighting
I cant say enough good things about this mouse
to set up
use
has some of the best accuracy ive
the best accuracy ive ever seen

took a long time to get used to this mouse
a long time to get used to this mouse being
this mouse being different but im glad i got this one

i find myself accidently changing
changing the dpi which makes
which makes me
me have to change
erase that button from the logitech settings
wish the button was harder to press
to press or maybe a little higher up
using the Razer Deathadder
experiencing double clicking issues with both.It took
both.It took me a few days to get used
a few days to get used to the higher weight
it look better
it feels so much more premium and quality
I replaced my old Logitech with this one
Love the customization of the lighting effects and weights
to set up
use
Setting the light to white still
produces a blue tint
do not care about that
The mouse feels great
button clicks feel smooth and precise
It looks weird as hell
it feels like a million bucks
this feels better than my Razor death adder or old g500
prefer the G602 over this one my son
my son likes this one better
you ca n't go wrong with either one
have to decide if you
you want a wire or not
the G602 take 1 or 2 AA batteries
lasts a while
I 've never purchased a gaming mouse before
I can tell you there 's
there 's enough buttons to make
enough buttons to make you
you smile
I 'm using it with a xim4
a xim4 plugged into my ps4

you program it on your PC
a button to swap profiles
you can switch
You can also set the DPI led lights
the DPI led lights to show you
lights to show you what profile you

went overboard picking this mouse
I wanted the best out there

It feels weird if you
you have not used a macros mouse at the time
you will love it
I feel like a mouse is
People have different sized hands
use different grips
I use a palm grip
have very small hands
tend to favor a heavier mouse
I looked at what felt
what felt like all of
choosing this one
I think I like it
it feel reminds me a lot
reminds me a lot of my Logitech
I had forever
I liked the way it fit
it fit into my hand a lot
I could n't pull the trigger on it
it seemed to me
The G502 has some heft to it
I would n't suggest it for someone
who likes a light feel
the Logitech g13 programmable keypad
A must have for ur computer/ps4 games
Love it
Top notch feel for a smaller mouse
provides all the adjustability one could ever hope
all the adjustability one could ever hope for
I upgraded from a razer mamba
has customizability
functions far better than the mamba
I have ever used
my gameplay has improved drastically using this mouse
I had so far
to use

they 're doing

I love a heavy mouse.
Quality feel to the whole thing
I love the design

this thing deserved it
I love it
It 's shaped like a fighter jet

I had to come back to the G502
look no further
Go for the G502
Getting more "kills

I 'm blown away by both
I thought it was

wont really make much use of the weights
i also like the overall construction of
it contours to my hand personally
precise mouse works great for
I have tried in my life
I had one SteelSeeries Rival 100 with 6 months

Using this for a little while now
it 's performance
I have the mouse
This mouse replaced my aging Logitech MX510 ( red )
Having explored much of Logitech 's gaming line-up
owned
It checks all the boxes
killer looks
the G502 has a " G
shaped RGB light that can be tuned via
's software to match your color scheme
I achieved a wicked black/orange color motif
fails on my primary desktop
I 'll probably replace it with a G502
working with large spreadsheets/webpages
they allow for more control over
the accompanying weights helped me achieve that whenever
that whenever i need
did n't like the sniper button when
it messes up muscle memory especially when
playing fast pace games like overwatch so i
did n't allow me to have a perfectly comfortable grip on
me to have a perfectly comfortable grip on the mouse
I normally put my thump
Same thing goes for G402 which

this can differ from person to
It come with all the options that
the logitech gaming software have and it is one

you will know what I
I mean
Love this mouse
I received an open box product
did n't buy one )
that has been since resolved from Amazon
they sold it to me
The Logitech gaming software leaves a lot
I 've ever used
I would highly highly recommend it .Short background
I built a PC
wanted to get a good mouse for gaming and
I had not owned or used a gaming mouse
I will never not have a mouse as good or better
I 've considered buying one for my work computer
I love
I need to train myself to use the ancillary buttons
myself to use the ancillary buttons more in
they work great when gaming.This

I adjusted the weight right away
it feels perfect
I value most in the physical product
this mouse does very well
Each click feels substantial and satisfying
it works
it has made a big difference to the way
I play
I found below my expectations was
I had to download it from Logitech
it did n't install properly the first few times I
I tried
I do n't know what was
acquiesced and installed the accompanying overlay software it
it worked
highly recommended
I do n't use it for gaming
I use the Logitech software to map
some Photoshop and Lightroom commands that I
I use very often
The mouse can detect which software you
will change to whatever layout you
it works with mac is
I use it together with
It 's unbelievable smooth
works
it has lost the some of the smoothness
it has the heft to really provide a mechanical connection
the heft to really provide a mechanical connection to a game
that adjust sensitivity are both easily accessible and
I have hit one accidentally exactly once
I 'm using it with a macbook
The ability to change the color of the logo
I paid full price for this item
I would n't hesitate to recommend it to others
I 've ever used
i love it
Love the weighting
It took some getting used
some getting used to
Love every bit of it
You have to move your hand up to press the thumb key
your hand up to press the thumb key on the side
you can get this on sale
The back/forward side buttons took some getting used
some getting used to
I prefer the higher palm rest of the g602
I came from
overall build quality of this mouse are
you 're into that kinda thing
you should definitely give this one a shot
It feels great

I use claw grip
thought this mouse would be way to
me to hold comfortably
reciving it I am very glad
I bought it
to hold for long periods of time
to use the thumb macros
you do n't accidentally switch profiles mid game
The infinite scroll wheel may seem like kind of a stupid feature
I thought it was before
I purchased the mouse
I ended up using it
using it more and more
browsing the interwebs it comes in
it comes in handy
all I 'd say this mouse is worth
that feels very comfortable
I use a claw grip when gaming
to use
all feel awesome
it cleans up after a year
I would like ( have been using a G500 for years
it comes with awesome features
I expect from a logitech product
functions well and reliably
I bought this for my wife
she has much smaller hands than
I do
to worry
she tried it
loved how
I have been running the Logitech G5 with 18 grams
I think the G5 is on
I felt it was time
I know there 's a lot
there 's a lot of reviews
what feels like zero acceleration
goes where you want
you want it
you adjust all sorts of things
enable extra features
you have other Logitech hardware on your machine
it will detect those too
I have a 1080P , stereo mic , video conference camera from Logitech
it let me adjust new options on it
The sniper button seemed pointless at first
I used it in CS:GO and Overwatch
Turns out it 's extremely useful.
it 's extremely useful. In one 2 hour sitting
game increased dramatically
You will not regret buying this.The comfort level is exactly
that 's why I kept
I kept it for so long
The scroll wheel being either clicky or super smooth with a push
Get the Logitech software
It allows you to calibrate the sensor
you to calibrate the sensor for your surface
it DOES make a difference
Tweak the DPI setting to what feels
what feels good for you
you 're picky take the 5 minutes
take the 5 minutes to tune
the 5 minutes to tune it
it in.3
Go play some games
feel the difference .tl :dr
No regrets
Buy it
Having fantastic balance
the weights makes it work well
Tried to go wireless

I looked to wireless

Love this mouse it 's really good

I 've gotten
Good stuff ...Worked as described
I expected

I 'm a fingertip stance mouse user
got it
have n't looked back
They 're a bit over the top
the top to have seperate
I understand the dilemma.The software is
that could go wrong is if
the back starts decaying
wo n't happen for a few years
I 've used Logitech mice for as long as
I can remember
I 've used from Logitech
I upgraded my dying G700s mouse to this and
do not like wired mice
this one has worked so well
I do n't mind the interference that the wire
the wire causes on moune movement
It does everything a mouse
a mouse does
to do. The overall hardware of the mouse is
to use
The side mouse buttons look obtrusive
you 'll almost never press them by accident
The wire being heavy is
makes it a lot more durable
weighs the mouse down
pull up a bit more wire than
you 'll need
tape it down so that
it down so that it
it wo n't keep sliding off the desk
you have a perfect amount of slack
lets me easily edit what
edit what every button
every button does
I have is
you can have for the mouse
barely related to the mouse
you 're playing an FPS with this mouse
keep the DPI relatively low
being able to flick
to flick fast
you know
I used for my documentation jobs
I have logitech mouse for my daily use )

you need to go to logitech website
find its software to download
to plug and play you do n't actually need software
you do n't actually need software to use
software to use the mouse
want to modify some mouse features you need software
you need software to do
software to do that
wish you could adjust the mouse to
you could adjust the mouse to the size
I 've used a basic office mouse
I wish you could do is really change
you could do is really change how
the RGB lights behaved
I would like it to be statically
it 's honestly fine
loving this mouse
love the G502
that seem to only use my fingers
they added dimple stops to the middle wheel
you can move around the weights seems
the weights seems gimmicky
it helps the balance
to control the mouse movement slightly better
I enjoy that you can adjust
you can adjust the mouse sensitivity on the fly
You have to decide if the comfort is
Picked up this mouse after using
using a razer deathadder for 6 years
thought a mouse would be as comfortable
this mouse puts it to shame
has a plethora of buttons
buttons to use
I 've owned
I do n't play many competitive shooters on the PC
I prefer gaming mice for their build quality
I 'm sure if I
I tried hard enough I could reprogram
I could reprogram the extra buttons to do
the extra buttons to do nifty things
LOVE the feel of the mouse in
the LED can configure to the rest of
I love switching between the different profiles for
when shipping
you can reach all of the buttons
to use
The only downside i can think of is that
everyone else enjoy one of ,if not
the programmable buttons come in handy too
you wont need to drastically move your hand
need to drastically move your hand to touch them
your hand to touch them during gaming

it has been very highly rated by several PC gaming publications
this mouse .It fits perfectly in my hand
you tune it to your specific surface
your specific surface using the Logitech software
the software will detect your installed games so you
you can create custom profiles for each one
I did n't fully appreciate how
various commands binded to the mouse
fumbling around
removing my hands in BF 4
I can reload
throw grenades

a great mouse works very well BUT it
it has a very cheap and plastic feel

I switched from a g500 so
it feels pretty similar
it 's noticeably lighter than the g500
it 's less twitchy
I do n't understand the complaints about the scroll wheel
the scroll wheel being slippery
i have n't had any trouble with it
my OCD matching the colors of my keyboard , mouse and desktop glow
this mouse had rubber that would make
that would make your hands smell
your hands smell bad
I love this mouse its very ergonomic
I wanted it
it to
looks fantastic while
doing it

The ability to put the mouse wheel into "free spin " mode

The weights helps too
using 2 right now
it gives a firmer feel to the mouse
Buttons help to modify when you change
you change your playing modes
this helps a lot in Overwatch
I turn the mode down to
I need a faster feel
push the other button
there 's 2 mode for the wheel
I prefer the classic ticking of the wheel
some might like the endless scrolling thingy
I ca n't control it
I scroll up
it comes back down a bit
I do n't mind because who cares
who cares about rolling
rolling the wheel

Logitech made this mouse just for
they did very well
I have ever owned
my old corsair m65
I did n't like the design
I ca n't grip it nicely
Maybe a few more hours will solve the problem
I thought it

bottom mouse slidersCons:-Harder to press the side buttons on this mouse
this mouse compared to the razer naga-Not as
beats any other MMO mouse out there for

It took a bit of getting used

I had previously only used small mice that were
to pick up

anything else will seem like a step backwards
I 've had this mouse since 2015

I 'm very pleased with it
I 've never used a mouse with weights
found that the weights
I know people who like to use
who like to use them in their
it 's cool that it
it has the option
I found that having the added weight
having the added weight to the mouse itself
itself would strain certain fingers
a god send
WoW made it so gnomes
my left hand can with keys 1-5
Would highly recommend to any MMO gamer
it 's cheaper than a Naga
I 'm loving this mouse as for
having it the DPI I have differently scaled
I have differently scaled on 5 different profiles I
I can set it to for however
it to for however I feel
I feel most comfortable
The mouse started off all red which
I aim for with my computer

Can't beat the price
I 've been using this mouse for months
it has n't failed on me once
The DPI will occasionally reset
it 's easy to just press
to just press the button
Love the lights
setting up in-game commands
I used this for a months and still solid and amazing shape
concerned that this mouse
this mouse might not perform

I used to have an early Razer Naga MMO mouse that I
I paid a lot of money
lasted for many years
the first ones to have the keypad capability it was
to have a lot more in the way
purchasing this time around
I decided to take a chance with this one
have not been disappointed
Have been using it for over a month daily
The mouse tracks incredibly well across
I have some tables where I
I have traditionally needed a mouse pad because of the surface quality
the surface quality not registering well with the mouse
have not needed it with this device at all
I might have is that there
my old Naga had ( not counting the keypad portion )
I think you can use the software
you can use the software to reassign the dpi
the software to reassign the dpi switches to be used in
a more awkward position to use frequently .Overall for the price
I do
you will go wrong with this one
Bought it to play Mass Effect with
it to play Mass Effect with more macros
ended up liking it so
liking it so much I
I got rid of my SteelSeries Rival
I 've ever used
I 've been using this mouse for a couple
I do n't think I can go back
I can go back to anything
It feels great in the hand
preforms to everyone of my expectations
I have been using this mouse for about 10 months
I 'm
it started to turn off
bumped the USB part of the cable when
I thought it was just my computer
look physically perfect
I took very good care of it
it started to do it quite frequently
even just moving the mouse
it stopped turning on all together when plugged
all together when plugged in
I realized it had been the cord
it had been the cord all along
it would not turn on no matter what USB port
I plugged it
I had purchased an extended warranty when I
I bought the mouse
I called the provider they directed
they directed me to contact the manufacturer
me to contact the manufacturer first as
they offer an 18 month warranty
to find any contact information on the UtechSmart website (
I did find was
I received in response
They responded within 24 hours
I thought was
this worked well with my schedule )
the next business day agreed to send me a replacement
to say I was very happy as
I had already been without a working mouse for
I 've noticed from the first one I
I received 10 months ago that
I think
The braided cord feels more durable now
changes the scroll button glow as well
itself has changed
it had a smooth grip texture which I
liked
the new one has a rough/grainy texture which caught
which caught me off guard
came to like it better than
to like it better than the smooth grip
the mouse had before
I have read some of the previous views
wanted to comment on the mouse and software itself
I have never used a Razer mouse
based on a previous experience with their products
I have never been impressed with their quality or durability
a console controller should not break after two months of
I do n't really play competitive online games
this mouse has been great for the games
I do play ( Dragon Age
I wanted a quality mouse with tons
side buttons to make it easier to get
to get to
use a lot of skills quickly
This mouse has worked out perfectly for
a bit squishy compared to some of
to reach
work well
your thumb develops the muscle memory to use the side buttons
the muscle memory to use the side buttons without issue
you may not have quite as much control over
you would with one of
you do have control over
I found the software very intuitive
to use (especially considering I have not had
I have not had much experience using these settings
much experience using these settings in the past )
I love the glow feature because it
it helps me remember to change profiles depending on
profiles depending on which game
I want to play
it 's also just aesthetically pleasing
aesthetically pleasing ( lol
all the other reviewers have said the mouse is also
I have ever used
need a new gaming mouse this is definitely
I would definitely buy again
recommend to any of my friends
I 've been a longtime Razer mouse user
I 've always felt something was a bit
I chalked it up to
it up to a superior laser that
just adapted to it
feel a bit clumsy
I decided to take a chance with this mouse
to use with a simplistic and logical layout
this mouse tracks like I
I feel a mouse
a mouse should
I 'm no longer missing icons
missing icons or under
overshooting large movements across my monitor.My hands are
this mouse fits like a glove as if
custom tailored for me
my fingers fall exactly in the grooves and contours
