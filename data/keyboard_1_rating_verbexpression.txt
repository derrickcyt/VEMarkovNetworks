switching to numbers/special chars
you do n't have the shift modifier anymore to
They appear on top and you
you have to flick and search through
trying to switch back to letters
there 's a comma instead
Your last update ruined this keyboard usability
why add slinding stuff to it
remove the button options to switch
the button options to switch the numbers and special chars
its bothersome to slide the keyboard sideways
it does not even work that well
people love to fix whats
whats not broken
It 's
I 'm unable to properly type
to properly type words
do n't get kanji suggestions
You might as well bring back the previous version

Need to debug many patterns by native Japanese staffs
native Japanese people use
I uninstalled this
i found recently that this keyboard
dratastiscally draining my phone battery
Left my phone in sleep mode
when i wake up 7 hours later
that made it worse
Can't believe Google apps are
you take out the 'run
the 'run at starup ' permission
cuz other keyboards dont have
other keyboards dont have this
I ca n't figure out how to type
to type Japanese with a physical keyboard on
my Droid 2. I do n't use
I do n't use a virtual qwerty keyboard or flick input
Google will fix this problem soon
I 'll stick to ArtIME
which works nicely with a physical keyboard
The app seems nice so far however
I downloaded this in the hopes
it would allow me to use
me to use a qwerty keyboard
Is there any way to change it
any way to change it to that
I would definitely rate it higher if
it would allow me
frustrating to use
I ca n't write small letters
I can only input them using
them using autocorrect
requires editing the other characters in the word
It has trouble producing the same character
trouble producing the same character twice in
it switches to a different character
( Trying to type kaga
kept getting ki instead
I go back to edit something
ca n't get to the end except by
switching to the English keyboard
I appreciate that various languages are
I do believe we should have the choice
we should have the choice to uninstall the languages
the choice to uninstall the languages we
I find it frustrating that
it frustrating that I ca n't remove
I ca n't remove certain language keyboards ( that
certain language keyboards ( that I do n't use
I do n't use ) to make room
) to make room for apps
I use daily
Please fix this problem
I could not even try it as it
it consumes so much memory
The description says that the size
I have absolutely no need for all
these keyboards filling up my phone
What gives !
to switch between English and Japanese
I can on a Mac
You have to go into your settings every single time
every single time to change between
It 's the stupidest idea
the Android iOS wo n't let you have a Japanese language
you have a Japanese language to download
do support Chinese
that 's even harder
Id give this no stars
installing andd unistalling this app
goes as far as delaying
delaying the messages
the messages sent
had a problem until this app
I dont even know what
I can do to fix it
it matters
i have a galaxys5
spend my connection . . after 100 %
my connection . . after 100 % they

I hope your face gets crushed in
your face gets crushed in a freak accident

Please update and fix
I 'll keep the keyboard
Downloaded for the "emojis

You dont have to create a whole new keyboard overlay that
that 's so laggy its almost impossible
its almost impossible to use
using this app
keyboard cant keep up
try to use the gif or emojis
it opens a separate new mms message
Cant send any of the awesome emojis
i have to switch views to get any symbols
views to get any symbols even the period and comma are
trying to select the keyboard my phone gave me
my phone gave me a warning said
a warning said the app will collect typed data
the app will collect typed data that could include
that could include credit card information
sucks because I was looking forward
The keyboard doesnt recognize that i
try it again after an update
my phone warned me of a permission
the app requires that allows it
that allows it tod record everything you
try again if these things change
Using the keyboard kills
the keyboard kills my phone
It lags down to an unbearable snail
the emojiis keep trying to send themselves as seperate picture files
i use the keyboard on most apps
it crashes half way through tryping and not
tryping and not even working when it does show
it does show up
That 's thee only reason I installed
I installed it
I want to speak exclusively in a .s
it 's slow and annoying
to use
ca n't type fast at
I try to send anything
it 's an emoji
it says "unsupported picture format"
revise my review if
freezing my phone up
had to uninstall
It will send an image in a separate message
that 's it
it 's like the worst way of
implementing it ...why
do
have it add to your existing keyboard instead of making
making a whole new one that 's
that 's not responsive
makes these "emojis
picture messages not characters in a text
It can get your credit card info.
Does n't work on messenger or sms/mms
It does n't show up under any of
Just takes up space
please fix

it has never worked
I cant use any of the emojis
try to use one
it posts it as a picture
a picture to facebook
Cannot use the emojis on FB or text message
Only way to do it is to send an image
I would save a few good ones from Google
I wanted to do that
to turn this on
my phone told me that it
it can record everything you type
you type other than passwords
everything sends as a picture message instead of
[as ] need your location
Emojis dont even work
suprised that its worked long enough for
me to write this comment
App sucked
hit space bar without taking me
taking me back to the beginning
Nothing works !
only send as pictures
The Emojis Are Images
to send them as emojis would be
Swing
Nice try
clunky mechanics makes this a complete waste of time
time to use
It 's faster to just Google an image
to just Google an image you want to use and send it
you want to use and send it in a text
I love this app
it does not work on my G4 with
It says unable to add audio and emoji
to add audio and emoji to message

it 's essentially a keylogger
Big pictures (
you want to send one of them

They 're
they 're multimedia pictures
I had it installed for
it installed for literally 30 seconds when
it crashed
They 're just pictures not emojis
use them on IG cause it
it 's recognized as a picture
take a few secs to download everytime you
you send one of them
the worst , very slow and easy to make mustakes while typing
disappointed

kept repeating the app
the app had stopped
Did n't get to do anything
view a keyboard I
I could n't use

it tries to start an entirely different text convo on its own
it 's just my samsung galaxy 5
you click them it takes
it takes you to a new message
I have hopes it will be improved
I understand there is a certain degree
I give up when using a free app
using a free app but upon reviewing
reviewing your privacy policy the information you are collecting
i tried to send a emoji the button to go
the button to go back to the keyboard
the keyboard disappeared so it was stuck
I uninstalled
pops up with " share
to post it on fb or something so
ca n't just text the gif like other keyboard apps
I want to like this
Slows the phone down

you must fix the emoji section
I love Starbucks
Downloaded it for android
a hassle to include the emojis in texts
It takes the fun out of
I did all the steps
it says please select a different emoji and none of them
them show up
you have to get used to switching back and forth
switching back and forth from the different keyboards
forget trying to send anything on facebook
way too obnoxious
The "emojis " arnt emojis its an image that
that gets added
Dont bother downloading its a waste of time
the emojis did n't even load
I do love the concept
who does n't love Starbucks
The resolution does n't look that crisp
I do n't believe it 's optimized
it 's optimized for larger phones
The time and money invested with the developer may have been better used
the developer may have been better used with partnering with
It 's
companies to do that
It will automatically into an image in
others have said
They send as actual picture messages
which defeats the purpose of the app
get why keyboard apps need
keyboard apps need your location
It 's clearly data mining
Looks great
I go to press an Emoji I just get directed
I just get directed to a " share this app " page
DO NOT
has access to Passwords and Credit card details
I 'm really disappointed
wanted this to work for
this to work for me
I should n't have to wait for my keyboard to
tried using it on What 's App
got errors
the one thing Starbucks did n't get right
I 've never had a keyboard slowdown my phone to
having to reset it
want to say this is
Please do n't use it
who had the misfortune of downloading
downloading it
The emojis look cool
the typing part does work
to make this
I can do with this keyboard is
you want to use the emojis
you have to share a picture if it
It 's not even emojis
It 's pictures of fake coffee
I do n't like the keyboard
the emojis take too long to load it
to load it let it load
it let it load for
it load for over 5 minutes
kept giving me the loading circle
even the spacebar pops up ... Absolutely a mess
you want an iPhone basic keyboard
hated it
I love Starbucks

Starbucks emoji
