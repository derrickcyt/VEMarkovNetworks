that expected 
It does n't naturally touch the palm of your hand when using 
think the most annoying thing 
gripped it naturally , the right mouse button was depressed 
It has a very nice grippy finish 
someone out there could use this mouse 
Everything worked great until today , two months later 
left button no longer responds 
Rebooted the computer 
removed/replaced the USB 
everything works fine 
wheel does n't work when the left mouse button is held 
it makes some tasks very difficult 
arc makes the mouse little uncomfortable 
that much , now the right-click does not work 
didnt even use it 
only use it less 
reconnect it 
Last few months everytime 
mouse kept disconnecting 
move my laptop 
Now it stopped working 
horrible mouse ... barely registers 
then all of sudden died 
plug it into the USB port of my Dell laptop it doesnt respond 
Disappointed item stopped working 
light will not turn 
mouse was not roughly treated either 
It stopped working 
left-click button stopped registering 
depressing the button without adding 
have a pro gamer mouse 
It works 
right mouse button is always being unintentionally pressed 
n't tried other computers 
wheel sometimes does n't pick up the movement 
n't use it 
It feels cheap 
using your mouse a lot 
got the new mouse today , I plugged it 
it worked 
red light is not coming 
that i wanted to replace 
Sucks big time 
Buttons stopped working 
n't buy this one again 
Product failed 
light no longer functioned 
left on a vacation the 21st 
product was shipped 
few people were saying 
taken a closer look 
back of the mouse has a very low profile 
which does not support my hand 
already have small hands 
what I meant by ` too small 
both eventually stopped working 
right button stops working 
This is happened on three of these now 
got two

gave them their money back to buy 
hand sits 
mouse does not function 
It plays up on 
trusted Amazon reviews 
what we pay 
Are these things 
It last

have relatively small hands 
left-click button did not work well 
right mouse button sticks intermittently 
Just got the mouse

just send me another one 
It 's not working 
connected it 
mouse just not work 
Bought the mouse two years ago , rarely used it 
Now , the right-click is n't working anymore 
rather spend a few $ $ more 
have large hands I 'd recommend another 
mouse has a relatively small profile 
which might cause discomfort/pain 
really loved everything 
year , it gave 
it to function properly 
USB connector has become loose 
shame really , this happened 
returned it 
this replaced a dell mouse 
other quarter rotation is n't detected 
wheel works 
bought 3 
later , every one of them is not working 
lasted less 
Everything '' here means the matte texture

It hesitates 
n't buy this brand again 
returning this

Controlling the movement to get 
using this mouse 
never had these problems 
that rattles really bad 
mouse works 
sent a defective one 
it woke it 
It goes to sleep 
wake it 
that changes the movement sensitivity 
which then , silly enough as it is , changes the sensitivity 
click the same button 
faster movement speed has less sensitivity 
that requires minute aiming adjustments 
using photoshop 
Try playing a game that requires minute aiming adjustments , or using photoshop with small movements , and you 'll constantly be annoyed when it does n't read your small movements and your cursor does n't move 
ta give it 2 stars 
had HIGH hopes 
it lags behind anywhere 
use this 
n't find anything online 
threw it 
loses connection

cursor does not always move smoothly 
It stutters frequently

random spasms and applications misbehaved 
computer behave erratically 
then one day it started making

that was causing the problem 
Battery drained 
Battery drains too quickly

wheel does n't work properly 
roll the wheel , the web page does n't scroll smoothly 
It jumps around

It worked great when I first bought 
it would disconnect 
mouse quit working 
Scroll stopped working

that tends to make the mouse move at a slightly different angle than you expect 
this has never happened

notice it while working on my computer , answering 
made some changes 
reduce DPI settings 
which helped a little 
not solve the problem 
rarely give a bad review , especially on a cheap item , because I firmly believe 
what you pay 
it 's supposed to `` go 
using it 
mouse also randomly stops working 
put it back down 
it moving again 
It slows 
it 's going 
buy another disposable amazon basics mouse 
i searched 
This came up 
bought it 
it does n't detect minor movements 
move the mouse from one end of the mousepad to another without the cursor moving at all , albeit very slowly 
need a four button so I can get 
then the rollerball stopped working 
it goes up two clicks 
Scrolling is completely erratic 
buttons regularly act as if the button has been held 
cursor will get stuck

it occasionally loses connection 
manually remove and replace the battery in order to get 
feels like the lid to the compartment might break 
probably purchase a different mouse to replace 
not purchase this brand again 
Well , I take back my four-star review 
It worked well 
changed the batteries 
it wo n't turn on anymore 
rechargeable batteries will not fit as the battery compartment is too narrow 
fit , I would have given it another star 
has good tactile feedback 
It also feels good 
mouse has a horrible squishy feel 
tested it 
drag this across a desk , albeit quite slowly 
where minute changes are required 
breaker for some users , I found this unacceptable 
not recommend this mouse 
Good price , looks good 
So if you are an average user just looking for a wireless mouse to do the basics , to get by , this will do it 
doing any kind 
highlighting text 
mouse tends to track 
other mice do not seem to have 
do graphic art 
mouse is just not going to cut 
find me a mouse 
likely give it away 
it would be 
it would cost me almost that 
like to send it back for a refund but not sure how much of a hassle it would be , I paid $ 10 
send it 
want to upgrade to a wireless mouse from a wired one and do not need the mouse to be able to do smooth small fine detail like I do , then this mouse should work fine 
smooth small fine detail like I do 
not need the mouse to be able 
pay the extra $ $ $ to get 
delete it 
mouse hangs for a moment , very annoying 
It does not stick every time 
it has something 
not having a good sensor/DPI rating 
not recommend it 
enough and as a result does n't work 
Additionally , the forward/back buttons on the side do n't work

receiver was not connected 
It even ran out of battery when it was 
it ran out of battery 
Had this 
It worked well 
n't even pick it 
It stuck 
Returned this 
having DPI controls 
mouse has poor battery life 
that should n't knock the great points 
scored it lower 
hog , it does only use a single AA 
wanted this mouse because you thought 
giving it a total of 3 stars because it really is a 
since changed my review to a 1-star review since I believe 
Also , it took me about 10 minutes to get the old one out of there because the hole you put the battery in is much too small 
put the battery 
put the battery 
pry it 
's no way 
Others may have more positive experiences 
quality leaves much to be desired 
that fails 
what you pay 
It fits nicely 
figured now a days 
loud clicking computer mice have 
mouse has not been working correctly 
it is really starting to make 
wheel jumps and freezes when scrolling 
where using the wheel 
customize the functions 
had a hard time communication 
that I tried 
want a mouse 
that can do a double click by clicking 
mouses and one of them is not working 
mouse lasted 2 days before it died 
what you pay for 
get a replacement 
Changing batteries did n't help 
Also requires the jaws of life to remove 
mouse functions fine 
Click sound 
not recommend this mouse 
that fit 
However , the Product Description shows : `` Mouse size

Both have the same issues 
mouse `` sticks 
motion of the cursor is not smooth 
This is REALLY annoying 
It happens

maybe if you do n't actually need the mouse 
Hate these things 
mouse does n't move the pointer very precisely 
buttons do not function as described 
trigger the rapid scroll just like pushing 
company has no website 
change the settings 
's a reason 
returning this 
where the thumb sits 
it has n't hurt me yet 
Then there 's the lag 
that the mouse supposedly has 
n't have a clue why there 's 
it has to do 
spent a noticeable amount 
keep it

Sometimes when I right-clicked , before even choosing what to do , a new page would open 
screen would zoom in without my having done 
disconnected the mouse

one works just fine 
storage connected 
purchased two of these , one

Read the fine print on every link on the product page before buying 
i was expecting something difference 
mouse has helped my carpal tunnel 
stars is because after approximately a year it just stopped working 
giving it 
again it just stopped working 
Dust goes

it comes with is more likely 
returned several 
bought this particular mouse type 
never had this kind 
newest M570 I bought is starting to experience 
used this product 
battery tends to fall 
fault wasted over an hour of my time in trying 
workaround was putting a piece 
It does n't have to be Velcro 
anything adds 
popped up in place by the Velcro , the device works very well 
customer should have to waste 
fixing manufacturer 's thoughtless design 
put a piece of foam on the inside of the cover , it would have earned my four - or five-star review 
sent it back 
Mouse arrived 
found ball to be inefficient 
Tried out mouse 
what you pay 
spend more to get 
it has eliminated my elbow pain 
battery has to be changed 
tried fresh batteries 
owned more than one 
not make a wired version , so in the past I 've switched 
this can go 
n't understand the claim 
That works great for a year or two before the buttons start 
maybe they 've fixed the battery problem 
one eats batteries 
wheel does n't work 
used it 
which became extremely frustrating 
ball became 
it was just going to take 
person , and dust your desk every day , I would not recommend this item 
However , the one i ordered 
scrolls roughly and barely works 
try to scroll , the screen moves very choppy 
double click function also gives me issues 
support this company 
i am very disappointed 
that breaks 
hate this company for making 
hate the executive 
who moved QC 
Logitech used to fulfill 
Find something 
that works 
single one has failed 
owned 6 + 
doing double clicks 
button either quits working 
found no other thumb-trackball 
Microsoft had kept 
QUIT working 
bring it back 
find a trackball mouse 
that will actually work well because I need 
it was n't constantly disconnecting 
always liked the trackball mouse 
not use this one 
cursor will rapidly jump 
rolling the ball 
this continues forever 
bought this 
it makes the job slower 
that need quick movement 
that I have used 
always had mixed feelings 
it worked pretty well 
purchased it four months ago 
it made a little difference 
seen very herky jerky response when using it , so I tried 
regularly cleaned the contact points 
that would also help 
Sometimes just bumping it 
it enough to work 
what I tried 
all rose to a head today when it just would n't work 
n't place the pointer with any precision without it lagging/stopping 
So I removed the battery and promptly slammed it into the garbage pail , resulting 
promptly slammed it 
had a similar experience 
that worked fantastically 
then it started double-clicking 
learned my lesson 
Sadly , I will probably never purchase another keyboard/mouse 
n't lose sleep 
it died 3 month after I bought 
bought this because it was moderately priced 
had a lot 
it 's supposed to be compatible 
typically just use Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 
have Mac 
So one would assume plug-in-play 
do non-out 
this hurts my wrist WORSE 
Takes way more effort 
it took to write 
that lasted 
Ca n't get used 
received it 
mouse worked great 
it started to lag 
It does n't always respond 
that goes by without it working 
n't find a neutral position 
hand likes 
click the buttons 
prefer a smooth scroll 
wheel clicks 
nothing I 've tried keeps it from flying 
why I bought this one 
left button on my older mouse is going 
one click to work 
changed the finishing 
owned lots of these , last one 
Feels more matte 
Why did they ruin a perfect mouse 
It failed 
service will wear you out till you give 
so did my wife 
first mouse is still working perfectly , however the second broke 
delivered Oct 5th 
buying a replacement 
ago when Logitech announced a new wireless version , I placed my order immediately 
then , I 've owned three 
devices worked well 
things suddenly stopped working 
mouse typically stops responding 
it works better 
soon it dies again 
Now , the mouse only moves vertically 
it 's like ending a long marriage

trackball really sucks 
give me a full refund , so I give 
use my mouse 
just got a lemon 
first M570 lasted 
not changed the way 
not buy this trackball again 
bearings work correctly 
anyone else buy it either , until they can figure 
who used the original -LRB- red ball 
who would urge Logitech to PLEASE 
using the thumb 
doing anything intuitive 
used your thumb on your phone to scroll 
play a game 
moving off the target 
Also the thumb and rest of the hand has the naturalness 
pressing the button 
that requires detailed work 
original Trackman wired 
it has worked fine 
only thing I liked about this , is it 's shaped 
got this 
Logitech re-created the Trackman 
ball had a dent 
which causes it to stop 
i was n't pleased 
n't used this mouse 
left key is already going 
use it 
get my money back 
return it 
piece will snap off making 
end is literally glued 
heat from certain notebooks will wear 
This has caused one of my laptop ports to sink 
that does n't even work anymore 
which came 
good quality company can fail at giving 
that comes 
literally just buy a new mouse

However , performance started to deteriorate

mouse disappear time 
n't used it 
n't stand this mouse 
It worked fine at first 
had it for a few weeks now 
it randomly stops working 
it 's frozen

then it would work again 
redo everything again 
that attaches

that will last more 
not recommend this mouse 
who wants one

later when I used it , it only worked 
Why would HP sell such a defective mouse 
excitement of receiving my new mouse quickly faded when I opened 
receiving my new mouse 
plugged it in 
it feels 
give this product 
0 starts if I could 
Thankfully I can return it 
also bought some of these for my kids to take 
get the USB receiver

ball has stopped working 
It jumps up 
nothing is working

Sometimes turning off the mouse 
turning it back on 
expect the thing to just turn

Surely , Amazon , you could make this work properly 
then the mouse stopped working 
tried changing the USB port to another port , same issues

that plugs into the USB to get 
It appears

So I can not pull the whole thing 
part stays 
mouse still works 
adaptor is stuck 
cover that keeps the batteries in place fell off

Amazon , fix your search algorithm

piece of plastic permantely attached 
it flicks off very fast 
Ive never seen anything like that before 
manual says 
that makes it very difficult to take 
it propelled 
not buy it again 
Computer sounds when the chip is inserted 
trashing this 
It connects 
It worked

Both would turn 
Spend a few bucks more 
maybe the batteries were needing to be replaced 
that did n't fix the problem 
money buy the Logitech 
purchased two of these , one 
mouse I used with the PC suddenly stopped working 
mouse I bought for my MacBook worked well for about 5 months and then became `` flaky , '' working 
not working the next 
which made no difference 
replaced the batteries 
bought a cheap wired mouse 
received it , it worked perfectly - great size 
However , it stopped working 
First shipment was missing the nano receiver 
Second shipment arrived 
Currently , I have two mice 
So , basically , I got NOTHING 
buy the Logitech 
had similar Logitech mice 
AmazonBasics works fine 
it broke after I have 
amazon would not replace it 
trying another one 
did work , I had no complaints 
one I bought worked fine 
It still works 
Then I bought two 
then the pointer started moving 
Second worked 
tried third one 
tried different batteries , on/off 
reinstalling driver 
Obviously others had good experience 
original battery was used 
changed new battery 
work , it always comes 
Strangely the rolling wheel got stuck 
Buy HP instead 
Cursor jumps 
Buy a better quality mouse 
Just not what i expected 
Buying Logitech 
it stopped working 
loved this mouse 
that I 've had 
Amazon sent 
replacement that I 've had for a couple months and the same issue happened again 
Tried multiple replacement batteries 
bought it 
It quit 
It eats batteries 
has significantly less battery life 
which used a single AA 
It uses two AAAs 
It stutters 
i use it at work so there are 
stuttering lasts 
watch Netflix 
keep this mouse 
ball does not work well 
still use my computer 
bought this for use in my classroom so 
mouse skips and freezes frequently 
It also does NOT have a good distance/connection 
It does not work even 3 ft. 
n't waste your money 
have a better connection 
it does n't 
given it 2 stars if it at least consistently worked 
Just what it should be 
Batteries seem to last 
cover comes of WAAAY too easily 
touching this mouse 
small children are highly attracted 
now you have AAA batteries 
Invariably , they find it 
drop it 
it takes 
easily this cover pops 
who does n't realize 
cover or mouse was molded 
not find anything defective 
mine appears to be fully formed 
which tells 
piece of packing tape across the cover helps this 
Misc -LRB- neither pro/con -RRB- When you unpack it , the Bluetooth USB dongle is hidden 
big deal , just do n't freak if you ca n't find 
used other wireless mouse 
that 's 
mouse would work 
It arrived 
reading material 
turned it 
which I hate 
whatever it is called 
it did not operate at all , so 
hold ` connect 
Basics wired mouse 
had high hopes 
it does not track 
it wobbles slightly on a flat hard surface , as if the lowest point on the bottom is in the middle 
Item appears to have been a returned item 
It is missing the usb receiver part 
mouse worked fine for about FIVE minutes before the left mouse button started 
returning it 
left click button does n't work 
becoming more and more annoyed with it over time , though , because it does n't glide 
It slides reasonably well when moving 
slow down to zero in on a spot to click , it starts lightly grabbing , making 
This results in it taking multiple tries to land on a clicking spot , as you overshoot 
none of it helps 
tried various surfaces 
Putting silicone lubricant 
helped briefly until it quickly wore 
mouse stopped working 
It lags and jumps all over the screen even after trying 
put fresh batteries 
has a nice feel 
mouse is going 
since gotten a replacement mouse 
first one would n't hold one 
Sent it back 
Got a new one 
it keeps shutting 
Changed the batteries 
it still keeps shutting 
Also drains battery 
then it just stopped working 
two of these fail 
which I searched 
one fooled 
particular mouse goes 
other wireless mice only need battery replacement 
Consequently , I ca n't recommend this mouse 
change this later 
even as it helps 
take a few tries 
that has a mouse pad 
this fits nicely 
use a lap desk frequently 
dongle does n't stick out too far for me , for all I 've read 
noticed it too 
So , all in all it feels 
update it 
only been using it 
it does n't work 
take the batteries 
mail it back 
It just stopped working 
get the battery 
It worked great for a few days , at 
receiver keep breaking 
that was just deteriorating 
which I thought 
it start to come 
Please upgrade 
Flimsy battery door kept falling 
Returned and bought a Logitech 
it does n't seem to have 
which it really needs 
little dongle that sits in the USB port of my inexpensive HP 15 Laptop -LRB- AMD A8 , Win10 -RRB- causes the USB ports on that side of the laptop to shut 
that sits 
So I use a wired mouse now , when I use 
that is still working 3 years later 
Maybe I 've just got a couple 
that came DOA 
sent me a replacement 
cursor jumps around even when it is just sitting 
reviews were written 
when it does n't work as expected 
does that matter 
it got 
bought this mouse 
So I get this mouse 
now I have two USB slots 
it does n't impress 
Mouse worked fine at first 
first one failed 
just ordered a different mouse 
it works longer 
piece of sh*t stopped working 
It is not working 
it stopped working 
not recommend this product 
it no longer keeps one of the batteries in place so it does n't work 
put it back in and then it falls 
not abuse it 
use it maybe every other day lightly 
what you pay for 
n't get this thing to connect 
just wanted a cheap backup mouse 
pushed the connect button 
mouse would suck if it worked 
Even if it did work 
door falls 
Logitech makes better cheapo mouses 
use the batteries it came with for my headphones and the mouse itself as a paper weight , so not a total 
it came 
it gets caught 
Mouse has 
worse ca n't seem to make 
trusted Amazon 
replaced the batteries 
Currently the mouse will not work 
few clicks goes off again

Had a problem 
Then it started to turn

designed ergonomically , it does not function well 
cursor does not move smoothly 
already bought 2

how it looks 
only they would send me a free one

wanted to like this , I used it 
eventually it just became too much 
it has a slight jitter 
pointer has very poor accuracy , even when not moving 
difficult , it just did n't have the accuracy 
play a lot 
tried multiple mouse pads 
nothing seemed to make 
bought this mouse to use

next day I connected it again 
it worked fine for about an hour then it disconnected 
using the connect button

Nothing worked 
Buy a Logitech

Avoid this one 
junk fell apart when I opened

left mouse button does not hold down when you hold 
click + drag sometimes drops the object too soon 
single-click sometimes turns 
problem appeared 
scrolling support

Then the left button started registering 
what it was doing

mother said 
Nether one worked 
Mouse stuck 
cord shorted

expect something like this to last 
mouse had a short tragic life

wheel has a feel 
that makes a grinding noise 
It does not effect the function 
what I will do 
purchased 2 
that fits 
First mouse failed 
Second mouse just stopped working 
's a serious quality control issue 
mouse had to be replaced

It does n't work 
specs are imprinted 
wheel get more clickable feel .3 
Real ones comes 
it took 
when i plugged into PC for the first time it took about 20 minutes to be recognized 
Even after removing this spyware my PC 
it went kaput 
Low quality , do n't buy this mouse 
that 's been causing it 
used it on multiple computers and still the same issue so I know 
's the tenet 
what you pay 
expect it to have lasted 
ona corded mouse 
Do yourself a favor , spend $ 15 
mouse only lasted a month , if you want 
bought three -RRB- feedback when one uses 
that I bought 
This varies 
other two have little 
prefer distinct and noticeable , tactile feedback when I use 
that has adequate feedback 
better Logitech V7 mouse also sold 
that appears to be false 
mouse is offered 
It does not work on all surfaces , as the true Darkfield products do 
hate it not really great 
buy this one 
now the cursor is n't responding well 
have an old Logitec 
that I dug 
n't buy it 
peripherals have a tendency 
what you are buying 
technology do n't buy 
Buy good quality merchandise 
spend the $ to get 
mouse does not operate smoothly 
have a 26 '' monitor 
this operates as if it were hopping 
likely replace this long before it quits 
It seems 
it to work 
oftentimes the mouse does not react 
not have money 
buy a better one 
it stopped working 
title says 
not expect that 
Wont recommend 
two of them have started double clicking when I click 
It feels softer 
bought three AmazonBasics mice 14 months ago 
still using the original mouse 
constantly breaking/replacing the Logitech brand 
purchased probably 8 
then you just buy another one 
grab your backup 
n't have a backup mouse 
have three working ones 
mouse has the three standard buttons 
looking at this mouse , then clearly you do n't need anything else 
which you have to go 
erase Sorry product 
which you have to go 
mouse makes a lot of noise when using 
plugged this mouse 
entire computer was fried 
fried my mother board 
which can result 
who the mouse was sold 
gotten the only bad one 
item seemed to be worth 
Now the right click suddenly 
return the item 
it has barely been used 
DON `` T USE 
> I PREFER TO 
that also side scrolls 
gotten excellent use 
Exact same shape/size mouse as other ... was hoping 
mice seem bit large 
likes a lazer mouse ... faster 
Optics do burn out eventually , like a light bulb filament , so kind 
so you have a backup 
buy 2 cheaper mice 
certainly requires logitech specifications 
MIGHT have better longer-lasting optics 
who knows 
want blue !!! 
get a logitech optical mouse that scrolls horizontal and speed can be adjusted , then it requires `` set-point '' software 
optical mouse that scrolls horizontal and speed can be adjusted 
that scrolls horizontal 
Have had problems with that software , causing 
requiring total power-off shutdown 
discussions by phone , with logitech , have resulted 
SO , I can not recommend logitech customer 
used their mouse 
got similar problem 
speed and accuracy are just what I wanted 
mouse has excellent resolution sensitivity 
Logitech corded 
one provides just enough size 
Only time will tell 
mouse I received came 
issue could only be handled 
seller would exchange it within a few weeks if it were 
not that put 
seller should have made this aspect of the deal clear 
it died 
changed the star rating 
mouse had only moderate use 
It works not good 
bought another better one 
lack of money , choose it 
which has a slightly glossy finish 
it does n't work very well 
Running Windows 7 on a fairly fast PC , I still had a lot 
that works well 
it works fine 
bought this mouse 
try different surfaces for underneath -LRB- mousepad , paper , etc -RRB- but nothing helps 
This seems 
It does n't scroll well 
purchased the mouse 
never had an issue 
purchased several Logitech mice 
It does n't work really 
one becomes unusable 
it replaced 
older mouse did n't have a problem 
it does n't track 
still have the slight feeling 
this can be remedied by adjusting 
returned this 
purchased the Logitech laser mouse 
mouse has good tracking most 
has soft rubberized sides 
had great ones 
available now feel loose 
returned it 
Clunky , just does n't have tight , well-engineered feel 
just have n't found a quality corded mouse 
pay more 
had the mouse 
cord at the top of the mouse started to show 
it broke 
had good experiences 
it will stop working 
It works when first plugged 
Unplug , replug , works 
Ive probably wasted $ 20 worth 
troubleshooting and writing this review 
Just tossed it 
Buy something else 
other logitech mouse has survived countless drops 
one , however , did n't survive being dropped 
bought it because my daughter , gted 
ignoring my orders 
now the original mouse works fine 
made some adjustments 
have no idea 
it too late to return the new mouse 
buying a basic Optical mouse 
Additionally , the packaging was COVERED 
dust made me very itchy 
one-click of the left mouse button results 
Adjusting the Operating System Mouse Control 
right and left buttons use the same type of switch but the left is used most often so it will fail 
buttons use the same type 
that were initially elated 
rarely use the Logitech B100 
n't expect it the function properly 
B100 comes 
However , after 11 months of use , mine started to randomly double-click whenever I left-mouse-clicked 
this causes some serious problems depending on the program 
noticed this comment 
that Logitech needs to address 
So if you purchase it , have a spare mouse available 
Purchased this for my wife to replace 
It was seen 
fix it when I got 
doing something wrong 
so of course I assumed my wife 
make some good products 
vendor probably knows that already 
ordered a wireless mouse 
it was listed 
It jumps 
stop and start all the way 
moving the mouse 
shipping costs more 
know that 
how they make their money 
that does this 
it works wonderfully 
optical logitech mouse purchased many years ago 
installing the mouse 
trying several attempts 
returned it 
DOUBLE CLICKS 
do a lot 
Luckily , I ordered 2 
try something different , perhaps 
that will most likely just stop working 
what do you expect 
n't buy another one though 
Get this if you are on a budget 
Which means no configuration 
It functions 
website has no support 
it would work 
only the buttons work 
technical information for this mouse assured 
ratchet sound of the scroll wheel is driving us all nuts 
husband says 
it sounds 
i buy this again 
price , light-weightcons - failed 
uneven mouse click -LRB- one sounds 
However windows and ubuntu linux does not respond 
curser go 
ball made 
Returned it 
It worked great 
Then the tracker wheel broke , and started just moving all on its own , making 
mouse has broken 
mouse will double click 
loved the mouse until it broke 
what you pay for as always 
Heck , even if you want to just place a comma between two characters with it then I ca n't advise it 
liked this mouse 
bought it 
sensor broke 
not recommend this mouse 
purchased other Logitech MX mice 
save money by purchasing 
wheel spins forward 
purchased this model 
wheel behaves as expected 
really have no review 
have the exact same make 
new one will not operate 
have the mouse 
had this same Logitech M705 model 
mouse still works great 
wife really likes the shape 
adopted a notebook , she wanted the same mouse model 
So , we bought it again 
electronics gets cheaper 
cheaper did mean cheaper 
M705 had a nasty defect 
eventually discarded it 
frankly I forgot my annoyance 
bought it again 
still likes the one 
Alas , the same defect just got worse 
when I remembered what 
one immediately went back 
mouse has a nice feature 
skim over the hundredths , even thousands 
chuck the wheel once 
it will be rolling 
scroll one line 
just by controlling the wheel 
where the cheap imitations fail 
release it , it moves 
causes the document to jump 
happens almost every time 
having this model then 
turn the feature 
wheel will be ratcheting 
So , if you want a free-rolling wheel , do not buy this mouse 
Beware this mouse

recently purchased the M705 after my old MX1100 finally wore 
trying the M705 
glossy black plastic part of the mouse is raised a fraction 
that will irritate your finger or palm unless you exclusively grip 
This leaves a ridge 
illustrate this issue 
how the plastic juts out at the lower portion of the mouse compared to the top 
Take a look 
Functionally , the mouse works fine 
Even with the mouse speed setting 
mouse only works 
it does n't work when you try

that it will scroll by simply moving 
scroll up just a tiny bit , the page keeps going 
It 's going back

attempt to press the wheel down , it scrolls unless you are very precise 
it 's just not going to happen

Pointer freezes , middle button does n't work sporadically , back/forward buttons hard

WHEN SCROLL SHOULD STOP 
left or right click buttons worked 
Obviously this did n't get checked when it was `` refurbished 
Mouse works fine 
All of the pads show 
it freeze 
Messed up my device driver 
that started acting 
one works properly 
battery covers slides open 
left button has made an annoying vibrating noise

Maybe Logitech figured 
This does n't work very well 
Mine had a lose scroll wheel , so the scroll would keep

Is this a `` new '' product 
when I release my finger 
what i want 
want the hyper scroll feature

that logitech sold 
scrolling down a webpage , the webpage will scroll back up when I release 
video demonstrates the issue 
opened the sealed package 
it is suspected to be used 
Wirecutter lets me down again 
bought this 
it has easy 
it feels incredible cheap 
buttons feel terrible 
Then there 's the fact 
batteries are n't fully secure in the mouse , so that they makes 
one gets 2.5 stars

Light went out 
mouse I received was a knock off as can be seen 
have no idea if the mouse worked 
it always seems a bit jumpy 
Using other mice 
first lasted just 2 years 
when the left mouse button gave 
recent one only lasted 
Bought refurbished 
it was passed 
it has gotten individual attention before being passed 
how folks tell 
buying refurbished 
Forget that 
that does not function 
one came 
Really dislike the pointer behavior/acceleration 
speed and acceleration feels very heavy 
it would work 
bought it after reading 
mouse does not work 
have a Corian counter top 
Everyplace else it seems to be fine 
i ca n't even click 
clicking is too loud 
scrolling is ugly 
wheel on the top has a defective design 
It 's so lose that 
Tried new batteries , although it had 
What can I say 
It just did n't work 
there is supposed to be a light 
sent it to my daughter at College I missed the return date so I guess 
Amazon did process a full refund 
bought this to replace 
n't have buy it 
prefer other mouse 
used many different devices 
it will only last half the promised battery life 
read another person 's review you can remove a battery 
which can be considered an asset 
questioned the size when I was deciding 
this I already have that 
which I hate doing 
hold my arm 
it seems making 
give it a little longer because I HATE 
LED on the top does n't light 
that I am returning 
it should go 
given a credit 
have WAY 
that has developed the dreaded double-click problem 
still Logitech has n't fixed it 
What astonishes 
Logitech remains inert 
It has caused enormous inconvenience 
Logitech has known 
AVOID SCROLL WHEEL 
IS DEFECTIVE 
let go of the wheel , it will scroll the opposite direction 
which lasted 
what happened 
new one seems to be jerky 
which just make 
it so hard to hit the target 
Tried all USB ports , updating 
IT FLIES ALL 
n't expect it to be at the level 
also did n't expect it to be as disappointing 
mouse moves the cursor 
e. the tracking , on my Mac -LRB- an '08 MacBook Pro -RRB- is poor 
it sucks 
back and forward buttons and the mouse seems like it would be reliable 
cursor moves 
movement of my hand is not directly translated 
What I mean 
go to click , for example , the X button on a tab in Chrome to close it , I 'll first make a big movement with my hand to get the cursor close to the X , then slow 
close it 
first make a big movement with my hand to get 
simple thing is * super * frustrating 
suddenly the cursor feels like it 's running 
it takes way 
many tries to actually click on something because I keep 
cursor just went from zooming 
it zooms 
algorithm they have 
installed/not installed , Mac OS 
tried all the possible combinations 
tracking speed 
just could n't get it to feel 
why I 'm returning it 
using it 
that can at least compare 
find a mouse 
smooth mouse movement 
that at least gave 
mouse that does not work on paper , it does not work 
that does not work 
has delay 
where it works more or less well 
who wants to stay 
n't make a better deal 
that use scrolling because it 'll scroll 
Super frustrating 
get a sore hand/wrist 
regular man sized hands 
sent it back 
It does n't work well at all unless it 's very close 
mouse skips 
NEVER EVER again will I purchase a Logitech wireless mouse 
hit wood floor 
it wrote 
many falls 
m510 is very well constructed 
705 never did work very well 
changed my mouse 
It only failed me once so I thought 
just met a bad one 
However , this M705 failed me again 
handle the difference although I prefer 
pointer began to shake 
not capture anything as I pressed 
arrange it 
adjust it again 
touching pad did a much better job 
unifying receiver stopped working 
Mine lasted 
drag an item reliably 
then the left button went bad 
liked it 
off-centered laser sensor make very difficult 
mouse I ever used used 
had the sensor 
Switching between a mouse centered to off-centered makes it very difficult to control 
not make really sense 
top wheel spins 
device absolutely sucked 
cursor skipped frequently 
that works beautifully 
eats batteries like it 's cool 
have a 9.99 mouse 
run a marathon battery-wise , it sure does n't win any points 
how i feel 
accurate and the scrolling wheel seems flimsy 
quality is lacking 
this could be why the wheel feels 
logitech got rid 
It seems 
what I liked 
Putting the scroll wheel 
that they seem to have fixed 
maybe you can figure it 
found a lot 
none of which have solved my problem 
ever had a mouse 
several Logitech products included 
had a wide variety 
that tracked this poorly on so many surfaces 
found it to have 
it might -RRB- I might even have to downgrade 
mouse starts suffering 
which some reviews suggest 
put a lot 
build quality seems fine 
turned on the mouse 
disconnected my old Logitech Mouse 
plugged the receiver 
drivers were being installed 
it showed 
unplugged the receiver 
put the batteries 
then plugged my old mouse 
Now it wo n't work either 
's not much 
that was creating a issue 
it would clear out anything 
Now , for the past 30 mins , my computer screen says 
Windows is loading files 
go mouse 
Ca n't seem to find 
this was going to be the rock stars 
Did my research before buying 
USB receiver just suddenly stopped working 
computer could no longer read the USB receiver 
plugging it into all my USB ports to try 
changing mouse batteries , restarting 
Contacted the seller 
window , a brand new product should n't fail 
Contacted Amazon customer service -- who freakin ' awesome as always -- immediately agreed to refund 
who freakin ' awesome 
that are known to fail 
use mechanical switches 
Searching for `` unintended double click '' should reveal that much 
bad batches or statistical manufacturing defects might make 90 % 
it has become almost unusable 
it fixed 
probably be ordering new switches 
n't have the time 
just buy a different brand mouse 
register an account 
fully breaking the mouse 
mice need to CLICK 
it seems overly aggressive 
I might get 
looking mouse with some nice features but laggy as heck even after messing 
got off ebay 
mouse started having 
this shipped 
It came 
button would not work 
change the mode 
It was stuck 
way to change the mode was somehow lifting the button 
once you press it 
then too the button will be stuck again 
opened a warranty claim with logitech as I fear 
return this back to amazon , I might receive another melon 
n't have high hopes since one reviewer mentioned 
logitech snubbed them because they do n't consider 
logitech denies warranty claim 
contacted Logitech 
shipping the new mouse 
one goes in trash once the new one comes 
which I faced 
Hopefully that does not have the issues 
opened it today to use 
Mouse from Logitech arrived 
one is also having same problem 
definitely not chasing logitech 
where you buy this mouse 
getting a defective one 
it will bounce around because the roller is shifting 
it arrived 
button was either manufactured poorly or 
it was damaged 
wheel would move side to side when using 
this caused erratic actions 
Uninstall , reinstall , update bla bla bla 
told them the issue 
disable the wheel completely 
workaround only verified my suspicions 
laser works very differently 
mouse looks 
never purchase this mouse again 
advise anyone else 
Buying a Logitech mouse 
bought mine 
it lasted 2 or 3 years before it died 
all of my Logitech mouses lasted 2 or 3 years before they died 
gave it two stars because if you 're okay with that , then it 's great 
then ... it will stop functioning 
have great features 
honor their warranty 
It contains 2 AA bateries 
This makes it too heavy 
weight makes it uncomfortable 
height tilts your wrist up 
only use it until I get 
keep it 
use it the more I dislike 
use this 
rather replace the battery 
it started to have 
Honestly , I will never buy a Logitech mouse again 
These used to last five or more years before any issues arose 
that plagues all Logitech mice 
now trying the Amazon Basic Wireless mouse 
returned the first one I got because the wheel would not `` lock 
It would randomly scroll without me even touching 
When I received the replacement 
later when it started doing 
it seemed to work 
It is infuriating 
Absolute garbage middle click 
bought this 
it 'll activate the horizontal scroll buttons 
Who even ever uses the horizontal scroll wheel buttons anyway 
Just sacrifice that 
rarely use this since I need 
It seems to be pretty good when the mouse wheel is unlocked 
never had a mouse 
that make frequent use 
bought this mouse 
loved it until the USB connector stopped 
now the middle scroll button does not work properly 
purchased this mouse a little 
locking mechanism for the scroll does not stay 
which I ca n't complain 
breaking this fast 
hardware can use some work 
one took out the CD 
that is included 
bought this product based on reviews 
left mouse button does n't work 
when you click it 
It worked maybe 
also because it was noted as working

when pushing the buttons 
Things have come a long , long way since the 1980 's , but a lousy product is still just that 
tracking , the buttons must be pounded on to work 
desktop it was intended for works lightning fast , this mouse is just a poor choice , I have returned it

Purchased two , one did n't work so well

30 $ gone down the drain 
bought two 
button is screwed 
it gets stuck 
pushing the mode shift button up 
which has gotten way too expensive 
mouse felt light 
lost my faith 
mouse does n't recognize it 
Sometimes the click is felt 
it will lose the hold midway 
double click is recognized 
it only lasted 
loved this mouse when I first got 
Eventually it got 
where every other click 
It makes things 
really liked this mouse 
now it randomly scrolls and/or zooms when I do n't ask 
it developed an issue 
button also seems to have failed 
missed the return date

Unfortunately , wireless never seems to like 
switch moves uncontrolably 
's scratch 
not recommend the Product 
left mouse button is pushed 
mouse worked well 
then it started to double 
many other customers are having the same experience 
especially when doing design work 
It does have some nice features with the long battery life , two scroll wheel options 
fix the issue 
users have posted videos / guides 
how to open the mouse up 
perform surgery 
n't have any intention 
issue and many other users have the same problem 
UPDATE 11/29/16 - Review changed 
process took almost 2 months 
which randomly stops working 
also recently had similar issues 
purchasing input devices 
wheel on this mouse enrages me more than I thing 
get anywhere near the dang thing it scrolls , it feels like someone is playing 
gave the `` freewheeling scrollwheel 
it 's gotten steadily harder 
worst part is I think 
how the thing is supposed to work 
reports of them breaking 
have mechanic hands 
it 's breaking when you press 
The under the scroll wheel button feels 
back/forward buttons live about where I expect 
It works great 
that I 've experienced this same problem 
find something different 
always owned Logitech mice 
M705 is meant to replace 
it was labeled 
which should have meant 
which is listed 
it IS a little shorter 
this may be considered a portable mouse 
It does counter a few things 
It clicks quite loudly 
it would scroll smoothly 
replaced batteries 
M510 was rated 
worked fine 
long my first one lasted 
find an alternative 
it wears out quickly 
Had 2 , both failed the same way 
micro switches go bad 
Logitech should get another vendor 
purchased three 
which results 
never gave me trouble 
using the same mouse 
replaced it after the left click button became 
put a lot 
Unfortunately , Logitech 's quality has slipped 
Luckily , Amazon has a good return policy 
cover keeps sliding 
bought this mouse based on research 
When in rolling mode it hops 
issue with a single left click being wrongly registered 
few comments about Logitech replaced the faulty part 
now , a year later , I 've been experiencing the dreaded double click problem 
So , I bought this mouse 
unintentional double click issue makes it extremely annoying 
that it failed so soon 
green light came on indicating 
it had power 
necessary drivers were installed 
n't missing something obvious 
tried different batteries , different computers and another co-worker to make 
Mouse was returned 
n't stand any bit 
i notice it 
i move the mouse 
owned Logitech products 
tried every configuration in the settings -LRB- acceleration and speed -RRB- to get 
bought an inexpensive EagleTec 
What happened 
It seems like it purposely does n't go 
want it to 
It has nice weight 
all of that does n't matter if it does n't move 
expect it to 
It does n't track well 
buttons do not click very good 
used a Logitech mouse 
where I normally use my computer 
Basic 10 dollar wired mouse still works 
register small mivro movements 
pinpoint items 
how to program it 
cover easily comes 
it goes left 
Tracking drifts left when I move 
wheel does not work tilting 
buttons on the side are easily clicked 
Clicking and scroll wheel 
getting this 
it wont stop scrolling 
it travels 
it bounces around 
It wo n't hold still to click 
throwing this away 
bought this to replace 
had many Logitech products 
never had a problem 
mouse tracks very erratically 
used my corded mouse on 
cursor skips 
wheel broke 
scrolling became erratic too 
Product arrived 
It also arrived broken 
Tried multiple computers 
light never responded 
awkward mouse movement , uses different accelerations 
lagged every time 
i moved it 
it felt 
Messed with every setting possible , did n't change anything 
it does n't matter when it ca n't track 
have their G930 headset 
also have their top 
that I have ever seen 
have own many Logitech mouses 
that would want to put 
did !!!!! The scroll wheel 
this does work 
that allows you to scroll 
take your finger off of the scroll wheel it keeps on scrolling 
use the other finger to click 
What you have to do 
cause it to start 
sometimes just grabbing the mouse 
it just starts to scroll 
ever had the misfortune 
this go 
who buy it 
then do a google search 
why I purchased this mouse 
that I read 
listed this 
person who wrote this review never tried 
who wrote this review 
purchasing this mouse 
mouse should work 
hate this mouse so much 
work GREAT the way 
purchased two other mouses 
one should fail 
that I use daily 
use it 
bought this 
mouse did n't cut it 
middle mouse button is set too far back 
it has the side 
causes MMB to be wobbly 
causes loads 
who actually uses the MMB 
usually enjoy logitech devices 
someone will find this product great 
life absolutely sucks 
batteries have very minimal capacity 
delivering this 
it could not be recognized 
n't damage it 
it just stopped working 
it came shipped 
new product should require a customer to fix 
this reinforces the idea 
mouse embodies shoddy craftsmanship/QC 
It functions 
it scrolls 
it moves 
It clicks 
that you can ignore until you realize 
it 's happening 
enough , it makes a horrible high pitched whining noise 
be all 
it works 
i did n't expect bad product to arrive 
i want my money back 
it makes the whole time 
's a very faint , but shrill beep noise 
moving the mouse 
returned it immediately 
all-important left button stopped working 
cumbersome , drags on pad , looks completely different then the photo 
replaced it already 
wheel does not work 
mouse makes a faint continuous whining noise as it runs 
not buy another 
it makes a faint buzzing noise 
move the mouse 
makes the noise 
it vibrates 
A must return 
it just randomly stops working 
bought this mouse 
n't do anything 
then all of the sudden just starts back up again 
it has been more then 3 months I ca n't return it 
that does not work 
not waste your money 
mouse registers movement 
comfortable , it fits the palm well 
need a cheapy 
RECOMMEND , will try the Amazon Basics model 
add says 
computer says the 
need driver software to use 
Mouse died 
that did n't emit a high-pitched whine whenever I move 
spend more money 
It feels cheap 
it makes a weird high-pitched sound 
whenever you move it 
not work most 
USB broke 
has a very cheap feel 
wheel has too much turning resistance 
review this product 
Well , I just got a request 
button is not smooth 
red light shines 
move the thing 
emitted every time 
it has a high-pitched ringing noise 
that occurs anytime 
mouse works fine 
mouse is moving 
not recommend this 
It works well 
it was going to be but for the price , it 'll work 
it holds up 
only had it 
initially posted a 4 star review 
why I dropped it down 
It actually started 2 days ago , so it was 4 days 
it worked well 
Including shipping 
paid more than seven dollars 
It sure did n't go into manufacturing 
shipping it back 
also was expecting this garbage either 
mouse was shipped in I laughed 
n't expect a top 
What happen 
learned a valuable lesson 
mouse is so lacking 
that I ca n't get it to land 
threw it aside 
where the plug does not get any wear 
bought it for use with a laptop since I hate 
just carrying it 
plug is bending 
it attached 
have different mouse 
that lasted 
not recommend this product unless you are getting 
where the USB plug will not get any pressure 
It has a RIDICULOUSLY short wire 
it does not reach the back 
tower is on my left 
How can you make a WIRED mouse 
Back it goes 
it makes when the cars run 
liked this one a lot better ABC ® 3200DPI LED Optical 5 Button USB Wired Gaming Mouse 
Using mouse 
wake every minute until the mouse is disconnected 
this going forward -- pretty disappointing 
Giving this 2 stars as it very well may be an OS X issue 
affecting mice 
not have the same namebrand 
What is shown here 
SEE PHOTO 
It was not functioning properly 
put tape on it so it works 
i folded the wire 
used it the right click 
n't refresh or right click anything 
it just does n't work 
it works fine 
Sorry I bought this new version since the previous model was fine 
who uses his computer 
owned dozens of different mice , dating 
leave this one a 0-star rating if I could 
n't leave many 1-star ratings 
it looks alright 
accidentally hitting it at least once 
when you put the mouse 
it pop in 
it struggles to maintain a connection , even before pairing 
which requires more force 
It feels awkward 
honestly probably never buy a Logitech product again 
returning this mouse 
what they used to be 
though , it 's supposedly built 
it still gives me a ton 
now I 'm only using it 
leave the computer alone 
just returned the mouse 
try it since I mostly liked 
saw good reviews 
scrolled a web page or email list in Outlook the scroll would bounce 
n't select anything if it was at the top 
n't have the bouncing issue 
scroll would freeze 
received a replacement 
mouse on the exact same computer and same dongle does n't have these issues 
returned the 2nd mouse 
Logitech asking 
not getting a reply 
Also , the back and forward buttons on the side of the mouse are oddly placed 
Maybe it 's because I 'm used 
find something 
returned it 
unfortunately the design flaw pretty much guarantees 
automatic shifting feature will malfunction in days or weeks if shifted 
it can be fixed 
mouse costs too much 
Taking the mouse apart 
that 's held 
only - you can technically fix the problem by opening 
that allows the mouse wheel to either be in `` click '' mode 
that slides down rendering 
it requires 
removing the mouse slider pads 
had two 
both of them have had the same problem 
wheel tends to drift 
it basically lasts 
see my review 
Logitech build quality has definitely gone 
flimsy plastic legs keep breaking 
had a hard time using 
Started as 5-stars but after a month or so of usage , scroll wheel spun freely , no racheting 
found this to be a common problem 
Opened it 
Loved the design 
it has got to 
have 2 other logitech wireless mice 
really do n't have time 
Mouse does not work 
having issues 
Logitech knows 
what they said 
mice are not working 
expecting a fix 
when it 's going to be released 
not have an estimate date 
which one you are pressing 
have this weird shape 
why they changed this design 
program it to scroll 
which does NOT include the ability 
firstly you can only reprogram it 
give my finger a rest 
is , it does n't work in most programs , although it does 
wheel has a poor implementation 
type scrolling feels a bit strong 
switch tables 
Also when you scroll it quickly it just scrolls forever 
it scrolls all the way 
So what happens is 
mouse is still scrolling 
Lasts about 6 work days 
which seems decent until you put 
not get a low battery notification like I 'm supposed to , even though it 's checked 
it has no wires on it at all , except when this mouse runs 
take pride 
have a nice huge beautiful desk 
it does n't notify of low battery like it 's supposed 
It does n't seem to be memory resident 
run my PC 
Logitech would just unify all 
mentioned before the ergonomics are nice , I have large hands 
other warts negate this plus 
running Linux 
running Windows 
i can only use blue tooth to connect 
i have to recharge 
unifying receiver never works 
neither could be connected 
used my two laptops 
it may be placed incorrectly 
unifying receiver looks pretty new , i doubt 
mouse DOES NOT WORK 
it constantly lags 
Plugging it 
perhaps there 's a problem 
tried all the solutions 
disable wifi 
find online - reinstall setpoint 
reinstall all the various Logitech software 
disable Bluetooth 
Nothing makes this mouse work the way 
so you should not buy it 
now you could use it 
charge it 
Then it got better 
snagged this one 
got the `` Navy 
have large hands 
's prettierIt 
got horizontal ScrollingIt 
BluetoothYou can switch it 
Was your AA battery 
lowered the warranty 
Logitech replaced my other mice 
why they lowered the warranty length 
* Ca n't use the old MicroUSB cable to charge 
which you use 99/100 
equally dividing the end part 
use the thumb buttons/scroll properly 
use the super helpful thumb buttons 
rest your hand on , half your palm is on the desk now 
inducing cramped/hover position 
hit both all the time 
that were published RIGHT as the mouse did 
who used the previous mouse 
video reviews online 
moved the forward button 1 FULL inch forwards , put that 
give this Five stars 
who are coming 
have large hands 
uses those 
it 's a fail 
MX was designed function first 
sculpting the mouse 
video shows some dude 
Master was designed by an artist first 
rather see someone 
hated texture of rubber under your big finger , it fills like it dirty 
remove side button 
u always miss 
i was using them to go 
cant believe they remove side button on wheel ... i was using them to go back or forward on page or window ... instead 
i been using it 
so i jut got me my Old - New Performance MX 
always loved logitech 
used their mice 
that uses the proprietary usb dongel 
problem for you , and you do n't mind having a mouse that uses the proprietary usb dongel provided , you can ignore the rest 
what I say 
mouse has great functionality 
explain -RRB- 2 
logitech says 
paid that much because it was logitech 's bluetooth mouse 
it needs to be a newer bluetooth dongle 
reading the instructions 
what you are thinking now 
paired and unpaired many bluetooth devices 
turn the serial access wireless 
what I am doing 
having the same problem 
just that it will work if when it is found 
exactly what will and wo n't work 
it says `` Microsoft LE Bluetooth enumerator 
that describes 
So , the program they wrote seems to be only functional 
dongle to buy 
users are having similar problems 
having interference problems with wifi if they are n't using 
users are n't having pairing problems 
website does n't work 
tried it 
still did n't get it 
turned off the pop-up blocker 
that would help out either 
bought a non-bluetooth mouse 
it looks 
paid $ 96 
reading many reviews 
left button intermittently stops 
never buy another Logitech mouse unless it has 
asking price 
thumb just barely reaches the wheel 
n't imagine anyone 
finding these more intuitive 
Why these were n't designed 
middle wheel felt entirely too loose 
documentation included 
Thankfully I had enough intuition to download software from the Logitech Website beforehand , because there is 
download software from the Logitech Website beforehand 
even after adjusted the wheel to `` Ratchet 
mouse itself felt way too light 
due to the heavier Corsair I 've used for over a year , what did n't help 
It ended up feeling 
Overall , most features quickly became more novelty 
not stablize the scroll 
owned a lot 
customizing the buttons on both series and superior control compared to other mouses 
had the issue 
bottom thumb button frequently gets stuck 
battery seems to die 
give it a 1 star 
really expecting this thing to last 
have the logitech mx mouse 
using the receiver 
Had high hopes 
it would not stay connected 
many had the same problem 
not give any more than 1 star since it does not work 
order that 
replace it 
had the older version 
needed another 
it had bluetooth capability as I have 
that make this mouse 
link is constantly breaking 
scroll spins freely 
This was not clearly described 
when I got it 
When I noticed this change I though to myself , whoa , this is n't going 
month went 
have better results 
mouse routinely disconnects 
mouse works fine 
that does n't exactly help if your computer only has 
purchased this mouse after having 
left button tend to double click when I perform 
repair or replace the defective product 
logitech did n't let 
owning it for about two months , the mouse started lagging and jumping around in every random direction when the battery got 
problem has returned 
charged , it seemed to do 
It lags and stutters constantly 
Even if no programs are opened 
Twice has it stopped working 
completely regret this purchase 
had the time 
return this 
using this mouse 
It ca n't keep a connection over bluetooth for more than 15 minutes with my 2016 Macbook Pro , not sure 
definitely would not recommend it 
also using the Logitech K811 Bluetooth keyboard 
n't have any 
connection drops 
which in this case then scrolls the window THE OTHER WAY , breaking 
First , as the headline implies , the scroll wheel 's protrusion and extreme sensitivity means 
it go 
freely -LRB- i. e. it will spin for a good 30 seconds after you let 
spinning '' scroll wheel , at minimum , takes a lot 
other issue has to do 
it RATTLES when you use 
Loses connection 
five-year-old Logitech travel mouse worked better 
n't make the dam thing work as described 
sending the dam thing back 
loved this mouse 
wheel has broken 
when it works 
bluetooth constantly disconnects 
use bluetooth headphones 
then the bluetooth disconnects even more 
running Windows 
bought this 
it would drop connection 
returned it 
tried several different drivers 
it plugged 
returned it while I had 
strongly prefer Logitech 's anywhere MX 
when it stays connected 
it does 
It disconnects , taking 
had to set the assistant to restart everytime it failed just so I could have some sort of useMac : - stays connected , doesnt scroll 
everytime it failed 
so I could have some sort 
got this with my k811 so I could use 
it doenst connect 
costing me time everytime so its useless 
which is partially decomposed 
Ive reverted back 
looks super cool 
it just did n't fit my hand very well 
China can produce 
it shows 
Manufacturer refurbished 
that gave it a bad rating 
ratcheting wheel stopped working 
it requires me to take 
mouse does n't work correctly 
have to power cycle the mouse or the computer 's Bluetooth radio before it can be recognized 
mouse disconnects 
which I did 
support confirmed 
Additionally , the scroll wheel is not balanced 
Sometimes it will continue to move on its own , after stopping 
wheel also sometimes moves when not touching 
owned many other Logitech mice 
repeatedly restart the computer 
app frequently crashes 
BUY!When working 
Master loses the BT connection 
BUT , once your Mac has gone to sleep 
go to the System Preferences Bluetooth panel and pair a new instance 
fix the problem 
connect another brand 
mouse can connect 
However , in the case of my Mac Pro , the mouse refused to connect 
yes , ALL the latest necessary Logitech software has been installed 
new instance of the BT mouse needs to be paired 
Fortunately I only paid $ 70 
pads do n't exhibit this problem 
it even works 
However , like many other Logitech mice , it only works great 
then the buttons start failing and double clicking 
build quality 
then 2 days later my battery stop working 
n't charge it either 
hardware controlled acceleration function 
mouse has some sort 
not disable it 
not control it 
Logitech does not give any attention 
unfortunately just received the mouse from Amazon , then struggling 
that would work 
not bypass the annoying accelaration thing 
Normal office use is annoying too , because you do n't have 
not select small things on the screen if you use 
lower the pointer speed then it gets extremely slower , yes you can hit the small things 
then it gets extremely slower 
acceleration does not slow down in the same ratio , so you again find 
Horrible user experience , but worse part is I learned 
buying this thing 
Logitech did not and is not doing anything to fix 
how to do that 
which tells you actually something 
it arrived with a broken seal , oily fingerprints on the mouse and scuffed pads on the bottom - very disappointed 
it was advertised 
purchased it 
bought this Master MX mouse -LRB- white color -RRB- a month ago to serve 
black Master MX holds the battery charge 
not fixed it because the guarantee expired 
contacted Logitech 
MX cost me almost 100 USD 
batteries sadly can not be replaced 
new one dying 
poor customer service -LRB- they took a week to respond to my email -RRB- can replace my month-old Master MX 
using the MX Master for 
waited soooooo long to have 
mouse lasted 
Logitech never made a replacement 
loved that 
Logitech was coming 
which did n't change 
looking and multi user assignment 
what I loved 
Master has failed to live 
wheel also acted as a push in button on the MX Revolution , no dumb button 
that does n't work 
Master does not play nice 
Update after update , still did n't work 
Ca n't switch 
Normally I would n't mind the price tag 
what I paid 
live up to predecessors , not worth even half what I paid , I paid full price 
posting this on Amazon to help 
this hurts my thumb 
forward/backward buttons are extruding 
Ratcheting scrollwheel thingnis cool 
scrollwgeel is poorly placed 
owned a half dozen performance mx mice 
someone carved a block 
have an early 2015 Retina Macbook Pro 
wanted a Bluetooth mouse to replace my Apple Magic Mouse , because my fingers are long 
it has multi-function buttons 
n't have a sore middle finger 
Logitech still gets their money 
store the USB receiver 
give this 3 stars if it had 
store the USB receiver 
bought an AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub 
mouse works okay 
USB Receiver must get interference when it 's plugged 
Who knows 
this will never go on the road with me , because it 's effectively useless 
Unfortunately the old MX does not work 
It works 
features I loved about Performance MX mouse do not exist on MX Master when connected 
requires constant Bluetooth service restarts 
bought this to replace 
that I use 
use the the thumb wheel 
which I found to be much more ergonomic 
previous mouse was set up to allow 
using thumb buttons 
using this mouse 
Working in the embedded computing industry , I see no reason 
drivers could n't allow 
it wo n't be heavily used unless they update 
part on the bottom of the mouse did n't work 
Showed up way 
deliver time which is good when when it got here all the buttons work and it connected fine but the tracking part on the bottom of the mouse did n't work , so had 
back and it was awesome at first , but short after the button that changes the scroll wheel mode stopped working , Then i had Bluetooth issues 
that changes the scroll wheel mode 
that comes 
what the mouse can do 
fixed the scroll wheel issue 
that you can personally fix quickly 
it will go back to not working 
i have an older mouse 
that still works perfect 
WHAT was Logitech thinking 
kept the the Performance MX 's front/back buttons 
there is known 
mouse and you find 
who fixed the hardware - problem returns 
Buy the Performance MX when it 's on sale 
Literally the s *** tiest mouse 
It refused to connect 
it came 
it has constant connectivity issues 
tried another adapater 
it disconnected regularly 
figure out a way 
sell it to you hoping 
reccomendations are basically saying 
it work 
*** tiest mouse 
read online 
where I wear out mice regularly 
why they would sell such crap 
received a really bad one 
Even damaged some part 
needed a new mouse 
had issues 
that came 
It had a nice feel 
mouse just failed to impress 
how it feels 
differentiate it from the competition while sacrificing 
start , I wear an XL glove so a larger mouse should fit 
stacked one over the other , you can not hit one individually 
layout of all of the buttons require your hand will do twice the amount of moving as does 
hand will do twice the amount 
software caused another issue 
new mouse software interfered 
keyboard uses an older software , loading 
only run one 
thumb did not fit 
extra shelf just interferes 
sent it 
Search the internet 
find numerous issues 
it comes 
it working again 
mouse refuses 
requiring numerous power cycles of both the computer and the mouse to get 
then , sometimes the mouse will disconnect while I 'm using 
Other Bluetooth devices -LRB- including mice -RRB- have no problem 
what I was expecting 
probably keep it , as I doubt 
mouse stopped working 
battery no longer holds a charge 
i got a refurbished model 
i might get the blue version sometime 
This has broken 
do a google search 
However after it `` jamming 
loosing the ratchet feature 
mouse should have this many problems 
enable \ 
n't see that 
disable the ratcheting feature 
so Logitech is not spending any resources -LRB- and denying that this is even a problem -RRB- to fix 
n't see any other Hardware revisions 
have too many bluetooth devices connected to your computer , the mouse lags

Magic Mouse has no lag 
it clicks Too LOUD 
make matters worse , Left click is 50 % louder than right click 
one clicks very quietly 
made a revised MX MASTER with SOFTER Clicking sound , like G602 , I would REPURCHASE THIS 
mouse suffers 
company is blaming OSx changes 
other mouse are working fine , its pretty much their own faulty drivers 
It falls a sleep frequently when you are using 
wheel broke 
which makes the mouse almost unusable 
It is permanently stuck 
MX , this MX Master has a few flaws 
It also has fewer buttons 
charging input 
prefer the weight 
MX has a nice natural `` lip 
MX is lacking that 
MX also does n't quite fit my hand well 
probably only use it as a backup/travel mouse while I wait 
add a few more 
which looked perfect 
part held true 
lot of thought put 
far behind where the thumb rests 
layout does not seem to help 
that you are hovering over 
that unexpectedly shifts the window 
this happens at least daily 
Instead , it seems 
Features for Mac do n't really work as expected , glitchy switching 
usage is greatly overstated 
it lasts

That 's 
it for the good , now here 's the bad ... First the cost of this mouse is very high 
poor performance makes it a bad deal 
just to execute a click 
Also some of the customization features 
Mac and with the most recent OS Sierra , several of the mouse functions 
many people have complained 
more OS updates Logitech still has not released an update fix for the problem , so typical 
breath waiting for them to release

offer a refund 
Logitech has finally offered 
software update to fix 
Unfortunately no notification of this fix was sent registered users

Also the issue with difficulty waking the mouse from sleep mode has gotten worse

used the mouse for a month before writing 
use my mouse 
used the original MX 
loved it 
get the MX Master 
Master , as I try to implement it 's new features , I feel like they are more or less marketing gimmicks 
add to the disappointment , the mouse does n't feel as comfortable 
customize it 
switch between smooth scroll , and ratcheted scroll , it kinda jumps 
ratcheted scroll 
it just keeps going 
felt like that was also a cheesy marketing ploy 
overlooked it 
carving the mouse 
hey , caving wood looks cool , so run 
how the mouse was developed 
new mouse does not come

Sometimes , it does n't want to connect 
review has been edited 
both of which I own 
Suffice it to say 
it 's meant to be their top-tier mainline offering 
Logitech has had 
which does n't make 
it 's got an unusually-high hump 
where the user 's palm would be 
previous Performance MX has a more smooth profile 
lower-grade mice like the M705 do n't need any kind of software help to allow 
find this VERY disconcerting , as I use 
have my character move backwards 
character would maybe take the slightest , briefest step backwards 
expecting a top-tier product 
Master does not deliver 
deliver the same kind 
buttons act like they would without the software 
one must set the thumb buttons 
SetPoint had the option 
wheel feels far more restrained 
adaptive scroll wheel , a large selling point of the mouse , has a very nice feel 
going to free-spin , I 'm not expecting the wheel to feel 
expecting that thing 
'til the cows come home 
describe the wheel 's lack of free-spin duration as it being `` sticky 
n't waste your money 
make a G602 with the G700s 's dual-mode scroll wheel , they 'd have the perfect mouse 
Sadly , that ai n't gon na happen 
n't buy this , get

gimping the scroll wheel 's side scroll functionality 
Options and SetPoint also both have a bad habit 
Really , most of Logitech 's `` general consumer '' software has some kind 
that reduces mouse functionality unnecessarily 
EDIT 1/25/17 
safely say that 
own both 
NOT BOTHER with the MX Master when there 's 
worked out that 
Furthermore , some of Logitech 's gaming products provide similar usability 
which is seem to be impossible 
have a problem 
found another bug which start maybe with moving the marker on my maps ... after that the mouse wheel wo n't work 
which start maybe with moving 
works fine 
which cost $ 15

owned several other Logitech mice 
what went wrong 
maybe I just have a defective product 
used it 
moves the cursor around 
had this mouse 
now and over all it works okay 
middle scroll wheel does not switch 
it causes zooming 
It is stuck in free spin mode now 
that wheel zooms 
It also affects just scrolling 
clicking the switch button 
wheel does n't click 
:-LRB- gunna have to return 
wheel broke 
which Logitech has not fixed 
n't hate the product 
wheel now only will ratchet , want 
only gotten their automated responses 
contact their support 
made multiple attempts 
had this product 
purchased two 
One of the devices arrived defective 
Indicating poor workmanship 
it can work its way 
effectively locking out left click 
it just moves the problem temporarily 
rattle it loose 
Usually shaking the device 
not repair it 
device is held together 
Furthermore some of the screws are hidden 
Defects happen 
support is handling the problem 
Thus if I ship my device it could become lost 
had a G602 mouse 
fail with a bad middle click 
This was replaced 
new mouse arrived 
not recommend Logitech products 
had failures 
purchased two different products

it took the device shipping 
Device was replaced

Logitech could learn 
spend a lot of time on my computer for work so a good wireless mouse is a necessity 
really enjoy the multiple features 
it be up and 
which allows me to scroll 
Ergonomically , it fits my hand really well 
It also has good battery life 
which is partitioned for both the Microsoft and Apple operating systems using 
have an iMac 
switch from one OS to the other , the mouse loses its connectivity 
tried both Bluetooth 
then It stops connecting 
Sometimes the mouse will work 
have these problems 
had to do it over again , I would not have purchased this mouse 
Ordered new but clearly got a used item as bottom of mouse has clearly been worn 
purched it 
it no longer works 
It 's stopped working 
it 's working 
It also had some terrible Bluetooth issues 
loved this mouse 
overall the mouse felt high quality 
it fit perfectly 
map certain keyboard keys 
found a little bit more awkward 
have smaller hands 
using the thumb scroll wheel much less 
reloading the last page 
Unfortunately this did n't always work , rather dragging 
Alas , after a few months , the true quality of the mouse began to show 
it just clicked less 
n't pay much heed to this - sure 
mouse still functioned 
then it stopped functioning 
handle less clicks 
Why pay extra for the special feature of ratchet vs smooth scrolling if within a month or two the ratchet stopped 
Then the scroll wheel stopped working 
just updated the Logitech Options software 
installing the older version 
did everything 
first the scrolling seemed like it was a slight delay 
waiting up to thirty seconds for the mouse to actually scroll 
Furthermore , the problem persisted when the mouse was both directly connected 
disable `` smooth scrolling '' feature 
contacted Logitech 
scrolling has ceased to function 
not deem the mouse high quality 
this occurred 
paid US$ 80 
sadly this appears to be some serious manufacturing 
purchasing the Logitech MX Master Wireless Mouse

Considering the quality issues 
cursor jumps 
full charge lasts about 4 hours 
that relly makes it hard to work 
mechanism failed 
Logitech has no good information about this problem so here 
how to fix it 
However , I see no point to having to go through this so I am moving 
that show 
how it happens 
what I 'm doing 
's a 50/50 chance 
it 'll disconnect 
use it 
It will not stay connected 
it reconnects quickly , but no matter what I 'm doing , if I stop 
n't have similar problems 
it reports its position 
that needs to send 
n't know if it 's flaws in the new Bluetooth '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' `` Smart 
AVOID this 
console emits a line 
device connects 
what this is saying 
's a time stamp 
that lasted SEVEN SECONDS 
it had a disconnect/reconnect cycle 
S. Like cussing clockwork , when I went to grab my mouse after writing this review , it had DISCONNECTED AGAIN 
Logitech can do better 
that does work better 
created a radio communications scheme 
already have a `` unifying '' wireless technology 
get this 
It 's called bluetooth 
receiver does n't offer much 
really what they need to be using 
purchased this mouse to replace 
which I had 
Master does n't track 
this will obviously vary 
MX and I find it less comfortable 
specific configuration of the buttons randomly stop working 
re-enable the application specific settings 
open up the Logitech Options program 
had this mouse 
then it started dropping 
it seemed to function 
Now it loses its connection 
it has the same problem on my other Macs too 
it has n't helped 
updated to the latest Logitech mouse software a couple times 
it would be fixed 
mouse has a hardware issue so I opened 
WHEEL BROKE 
WHY PEOPLE ARE GIVING 
device and software have obvious issues 
Check the net 
it 's well documented 
having such good luck with Logitech before I did n't do 
which to me means 
shipped it anyway 
guess it 
Logitech fix the problem 
n't buy this 
Initially , I liked it 
mouse was lagging massively 
why I gave this one star 
have ability 
connect Bluetooth 
It came 
It was lagging 
mouse is advertised 
It 's not 
mouse connected 
td-p/1381672Logitech has not admitted this problem 
not advertise this 
mouse can not be detected 
add functions to fast keys now 
attempts failed so it 's impossible 
However , the Logitech Options software I run on Windows 10 does not save the customization settings 
This means 
n't customize any 
both exhibit the same problem 
have 2 
that Logitech will fix soon 
find a solution , I will update this review 
not get this to stay 
have no issues 
quality seems decent 
never buy him a logitech product again 
bought this 
which was discontinued 
how a company can ruin a good product 
's no latch 
4 of which are hidden under the foot pads so if you want 
Then there 's a mysterious watch battery 
where it goes 
$ 50 + mouse should be having as many problems 
serious about their customers they would have recalled this model until all the bugs were gone 
what I expected 
It is designed 
which put my wrist 
it clicks unintentionally 
main buttons wrap around the front so if you bump 
it did not make me more productive 
gave it a week 
adjusting my position 
It also tracks better 
It gets 2 stars because it is more than twice the price 
what I think 
shape prioritizes form 
find both the $ 30 Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse 
perfect -LRB- non-gaming -RRB- mouse in my opinion would have the build-quality 
Unfortunately , it would n't look as nice 
mouse is not working 
wheel began to scroll 
It started out ok 
found out its common 
mice to have this problem 
Did some research 
Tried all software fixes 
plugging the receiver 
which is less then 3 feet away -RRB- , caused severe skipping/lag 
Resolved the skipping/lag issue 
purchase another mouse 
not return it due 
Lesson learned 
mouse feels really great 
first one I received blew out the scroll wheel lock 
same thing happened 
second mouse lasted 
wheel stuck 
lock wears down leaving 
This does not appear 
not recommend this mouse 
vendor I bought this mouse from marked it as `` Very Good '' , however I disagree 
bought this mouse from marked 
Typically this mouse would be returned because the ratchet scroll does not work 
Item does not work perfectly 
which is considered `` Unacceptable 
purchased this product after using 
wanted a bit 
still use it 
It took a while 
that can switch 
wheels had that capability 
It felt weird at first 
Now here comes the bad part 
ratchet in the scroll wheel began to feel lighter , like it was n't getting 
ratchet feel 
it felt like it was in hyper-fast mode 
it got looser and looser , until there was 
which I do n't have a screwdriver 
's a portion 
that moves when it switches 
which makes 
Repeated movement of this part seems to slowly move 
it lose contact 
problem does n't stop there 
permanently keep it from shifting 
n't found a solution yet 
feet/pads on the underside of the mouse do n't stick all too well anymore 
mouse has a nice design 
pointer constantly skips across the screen while using 
mouse do that before 
cursor keeps sticking 
nearby that causes the cursor to stick 
n't have nearly the same `` sticking '' problem 
it would not stay connected 
several off brand as well as one brand name mouse and non of these have any problems 
NOT recommend this mouse 
buying one with Bluetooth if you can not use 
other users have had the same problem 
trying another one when I read 
held my review back on this product for several months , so as to give 
multi-device connection feature works pretty well 
have 2 other Logitech Performance MX mice 
inability to go forward without needing to carefully press the button makes this mouse all but useless 
had the previous Logitech high end mouse 
bought here a Logitech MX Master Wireless mouse 
Now , one year later , the battery is not recharging anymore 
purchased this mouse 
otherwise it wo n't work 
Mouse to this date has never held a charge 
's say 
precisely move the pointer 
it would slide short 
tried to quickly , accurately , and precisely move the pointer to a button on screen let 's say for an example , it would often miss that button just by a few pixels , then if I drag 
explain the `` glitchy 
think it 's the computer , it was n't , I 'm running the new iMac 5K 
Even tried a mouse pad 
Additionally , I downloaded the Logitech software to tweak 
trying for a few days straight , I still could n't get it to work 
really customize the mouse 
Maybe I had a defective unit ?? 
offer no solutions other 
that not only would Logitech release this broken product 
problem is very well noted all 
that Logitech has become a second class citizen 
releasing innovative products 
THIS IS A BROKEN DEVICE 
COMES OUT 
Do yourself a favor 
it causes the mouse to skip 
Logitech has had an 
that they refuse to correct 
going problem with there hardware 
not buy this mouse 
online ratings are paid 
anyone avoid the extra hassle 
that does not function as advertised 
this helps 
middle wheel `` free-spin '' mode quit working 
still have n't received a replacement 
unfortunately it suffers 
which affects the scroll wheel mechanism 
Basically the scroll wheel ratchet gets stuck 
problem appeared 
returned the mouse 
received a replacement 
replacement suffered 
Logitech is having a serious quality issue 
Search online 
find a huge number 
let down and Logitech is obviously not addressing the issue 
return it back 
it 's get easy 
ago the item simply stopped working 
It does n't connect 
it is already connected 
filed a warranty claim 
n't received any replies from them so far 
expect it to work 
spend 90 $ 
lot of people have reported the same issue in many other blogs as 
ordered this mouse 
n't play games 
primary button has already broke 
use it 
mouse works great when it connects 
BUT , it always lags 
read different forums 
's some bug 
It seems like when it is used 
that makes connectivity unstable 
cursor will go crazy 
problem continues 
passed the return time 
returned it soon enough 
given too much time for myself to test 
fit my needs 
Maybe I possibly did n't read the specs carefully enough 
absence of a left back button was disconcerting 
had many different models 
had a M100 
purchased one 
that lasted 
right mouse click when you left 
Unfortunately , by Dec of 2016 it started having 
having the same issue 
Logitech would replace my mouse 
that lasted all 
it seems to be working 
prices have gone down to reflect 
quality seems to have diminished 
months use before they work 
It does n't have the chrome trim 
that is advertised 
information on the bottom of the mouse says 
It came 
It works 
what I expected from a `` Logitech , '' if that 's 
who actually made it 
sending it back 
it just died 
mentioned , mine says 
it eventually works if you jiggle 
That seems to be the weak-link when it comes 
much strain placed on any one point , over time , will cause problems 
One would think 
cord at the USB plug end would be reinforced to compensate 
again , the longer it lasts , the fewer mice you sell , so ... another product 
received a totally different packed mouse 
looked at the back of the mouse , I see B100 
make sure , I checked the package 
have many differences in price , set and outlook , cheat is cheat 
mouse , you ca n't sell it 
careful to read the label on ur mouse , that might gave you different mouse 
wheel does n't work well 
this does n't cut it 
needed a backup mouse 
sending it 
avoid this 
function is beginning to fail 
suddenly the mouse will `` drop '' it 
dragging an item 
that require a lot 
wheel makes a lot of noise , just horrible 
It did n't even last 
it died 
Had the older model for 4 years , loved it 
hate this one 
It seems to be working 
received a logitech B100 
using Logitech mouse products 
avoid this one 
get wrist pain

file a warranty claim 
It 'll cost 
that much to ship the thing

It also feels a bit light/flimsy 
long it lasts 
n't be keeping this one 
wheel is hit 
bought this to temporarily replace 
that long before i take a hammer 
it will last 
Other than an envelope weighs more

not recommend this product 
who has medical issues 
item itself works fine 
Battery went dead way too fast 
Even though I do n't apply any more pressure 
Never had this problem before 
just need an inexpensive mouse for word processing then its great 
use it to move 
used constantly or you use it to move around in your game world , this mouse might last 
do any serious gaming 
all of their electronics are built

LOVE Logitech 
mice I love best have come 
purchased a variety

do almost anything else 
play games 
return it 
more can I say 
play , nothing fancy , fits nice 
feels ok 
it grinds 
i threw out the plastic insert from the packaging accidentally 
feels SO cheesey 
i ca n't even use it 
what went wrong

Finally a friend gave me an extra mouse

red LED does not surge through the mouse as shown 
that gives off the most obnoxiously bright red light 
Aditionally , the see-through design really does not do 
mouse any favors when the mouse 's internals look 
actual product wo n't resemble the actual picture 
aesthetics will probably not factor 
most people are probably made aware 
it would have satisfied 
bought a candy bar 
not wish it 
It works like it should 
have large hands 
Other than that , it works like it should 
hand starts to cramp

Honestly if i could i would give this a negative 5 
Also it comes in a box by itself , nothing 
it seems to interfere 
still using it 
it never sleeps !! 
maybe the active LED 's in this thing are telling the Computer 
that I can find to counter 
this including `` Do not allow this device to wake 
tried what few settings 
all do n't care 
~ nawwww 
sleep mode 
Nuff ' said 
having trouble

It just shakes 
It refuses to work 
NOT reccomend this

fine mouse , except for the fact it is extremely distracting 
tape on the sides might fix 
It has no weight 
it fells weird holding 
bought this for my 8 year old son to use 
it lit 
wheel stopped working 
never transported or dropped it 
It stayed 
Spend a couple more bucks 
buy another mouse 
product is not working 
connect windows 
not recognize it 
It did a great job 
got it , it dropped 
received it 
cast it away 
had no any package of this mouse , only a envelope 
So when I received it , everything was broken , useless 
buy a little higher price mouse shipping 
It 's pretty when lit 
n't waste your money 
what you pay 
receiving it 
What could you expect 
wheel sticks 
it looks like it was made 
mouse seemed good 
it did not work 
First , it only glows red not blue 
Second , the cursor goes where it wants 
not recommend this product 
i could get this to work 
pad or table top did n't get it to move 
hear rattling and loose parts 
yes it does not function 
It dose n't even work anymore 
never buy these again becuse 
really have no use for them anymore 
just got it 
not have taken that long 
already both have stopped working 
both have only been used very little 
never buy this product again 
got this mouse because I thought 
blue light went out 
it broke in to pieces after falling 
luckily I had a USB extension cord 
buying a different mouse 
it shows 
what you pay for 
clicker sticks 
It constantly has to be replugged 
had one 
that lasted 
it was only dropped once 
Unfortunately , it died suddenly about a month after I received 
most mice , even 3 dollar ones , can handle being dropped 
It was annoying to have 
ordered a 
far , the new one is holding 
mouse to ship , even though it arrived 
So , if you need a mouse right away , I would n't get this one 
when I opened the package 
cables on the mice got cut 
get new ones 
plastic on it feels very cheap 
n't justify the actually usability 
It goes 
have a wireless Logitech mouse 
that works much much better 
what you pay 
needed a mouse for my computer since my touch pad was becoming 
got this mouse because it was cheap 
had positive reviews

Amazon was implying

Amazon will not accept returns of their items so I am stuck

cable does not fit the Hewlett Packard Oscilloscope model HP C03-180AR 
given this great dual ` scope 
Pins in the cable feel loose 
other one I bought from this company broke

NOT fit at ALL !!! 
it will fit all printers 
it would fail soon 
what is shown

ordered three 
bought this cord 
received it in what was a reasonable amount 
used it less than a month before it just stopped 
it just stopped working 
Now I did n't pay much 
one of the wires in the cable broke near the C5 / `` clover '' plug 
it says 3x0 .5 mm 
that means 
examined the cable 
standard for this plug type specifies a max load 
wire has a mas Amp rating 
NOT use this cable 
burns down because of it , you may be denied insurance for using

previous cable had 
It worked great

Thank You , Tracy G. Got the mouse to work 
mouse is not pairing 
so buy another type 
not repair this mouse 
Therefore I have no idea if the mouse even works 
Android has not solved this problem yet 
use this strictly as my travel mouse , as it seems 
movement of the cursor is certainly not smooth 
bought a far superior Logitech mouse 
mouse makes it difficult 
Mouse arrived 
Package was damaged 
It makes a lot 
noise then loses signal 
it does n't work 
It looks super cool 
where you want it 
It goes everywhere 
n't get the mouse to work 
It would work 
This led to playing 
find the cursor 
that solved the problem 
keeps freezing 
it makes a high pitched buzzing sound when its freezing up have 
takes too much pressure 
hand got tired 
Buggy - frequently stops connecting 
what makes the cost higher 
hate this mouse 
It does n't register movement well 
changed the battery 
never buy this product again 
received a defective product 
it definitely does not seem to work 
one I received had a scroll wheel 
it went up and down when I tried 
need it to be reasonably accurate

It does n't have much of a `` click feel 
which makes scrolling 
giving this mouse 
ordering something else 
bought this mouse 
working , I liked it 
compartment and contacts are very poorly designed , such that I was constantly reseating 
it protrude more 
It just kept failing 
ordered a new mouse

probably avoid Logitech products 
it loses its connection 
put it 
never had this problem 
mouse died 
It is only used 
batteries were changed 
expected a hot pink color by looking 
brilliant rose 
what I was sent 
this should be considered the color `` red 
NOT COME

as well give it a try because it had 
reading all 
It DOES look cool 
old said

Sometimes you can wake it up by wiggling it , sometimes by clicking 
Sometimes it still just stays dead

so got it quickly 
turned it

Unfortunately , it did n't turned

what you pay 
read reviews , I usually avoid 5 and 1 stars 
much love or hate rarely equals a good review 
However , this mouse garners a 1 star 
thing loses focus as I use 
Ordering a new mouse now 
what you pay for 
it might get better 
Buying something else 
it simply does not work 
greatness but the item arrived broken 
taking a gamble 
USB connector does n't fit 
mouse failed 
what you pay for 
n't waste your tine 
ever bought so dont 
buy it 
it comes broken and doesnt work you have to super glue the battery part back together 
have to super glue the battery part 
mause came broken !!! 
times new batteries are installed 
it does n't work 
read the discption 
It gets off after 30 mins if no activity is done 
It hardly works 
it broke 
it looked real nice 
expect more 
order another to balance

pointer barely moves 
other times only moves vertical inspite 
Tried all combinations of cleaning the mouse pad , using it without mousepad , changing 
cleaning the mouse pad 
how to contact seller 
what you pay 
order two 
it took almost more than a month to receive 
other one works good 
product is very poorly made , the battery compartment is too large to hold the batteries in place , so they keep 
get the Microsoft version 
spend the extra $ 10 
old adage of you get 
what you pay 
had high hopes 
It looks , cool 
trying to use this , it would n't work on my mouse pad , so I removed 
It worked only slightly better 
infrared , for some reason , is really weak 
what you pay 
It 's definitely `` you get 
it works 
It took way too long to arrive 
mouse pretty much sucks 
finally took a poo because I dropped 
it lasted FOREVER 
what I had before I bought 
what you pay for 
which I suppose 
it 's cheaply made 
cursor is constantly moving around , even when I do n't have 
keep my mouse settings 
thing literally has a mind 
it 'll drop emails into the wrong folders before I 've moved 
use it 
Suck it 
spend the extra $ 20 to get 
what I paid 
Terrible quality ... However , I should have know better 
Cheep , does not work continuous 
Getting my money 's worth 
it feels inexpensive 
searching or word processing 
that needs to be precise 
thus it makes heavy 
one needs 2 AAA batteries 
buy this one 
wheel dislodges easily 
not waste money 
It looks trendy 
however biggest issue is -- Ignored the basic physics 
palm stays on the lightest portion of the product causing 
it acts like it does n't read 
tried different surfaces 
it works fine 
bought a different mouse 
definitely need FLAT surfaces 
foldable design works a lot better 
it actually does n't seem too different 
plastic seems to be of high build-quality 
where this mouse falls short 
cursor jumping

still have a small , persistent jiggle 
it did n't work 
muouse is not working 
receive ，

Dont buy it 
quality of it put together 
this was going to be a great laptop bag accessory 
thought this was going to be a great laptop bag accessory , After using it for the grand total of 20 minutes , it 's going to be a great hockey puck 
what you pay for 
replace it 
sometimes Windows does not recognize it 
It stops working 
Ditto it fell apart 
n't buy this product 
mouse lost its connection 
NOT GET THIS PRODUCT 
n't buy it 
that I wish 
it came 
started it up the mouse would not track 
correctly I checked the settings to make 
look at the bottom you can see the laser if off center and the rubber feet are crooked 
it is always disconnecting 
it worked great 
Product fail 
It could n't function click-and-drag 
it could n't distinguish single 
it b/c 
using it only works 
lag in it makes it unusable 
spend more

Consumes lot of battery , had 
when it does n't stick 
button sticks way too often 
that makes the grip 
therefore the mouse not staying 
foldable rear part of the mouse that makes the grip for the palm is also broken with the hinges being way 
laser does n't register either occasionally 
remove the batteries 
NOT recommend this product 
one I got broke down after using 
wheel did n't even rotate when I got 
what you pay 
it broke 
used it 
it broke 
part that goes into the computer is stuck 
that goes 
it looses connection 
hold the batteries 
never got the label 
when it is folded close and upside down 
that turns off every 30 seconds 
what you pay for 
n't waste your money 
foil on the battery coils would not fix the loss 
change it either 
product came 
click of the mouse does n't work 
n't recommend this product 
It works perfectly fine 
had several Logitech mice before 
never having an issue 
got this new mouse 
little receiver had decided to stop 
expected more 
give 0 star 
brought this a month back 
it is not working anymore 
changed the batteries 
it worked 
that I previously had 
better buy a 10 dollar one from best buy 
percent of the time the mouse seems to stop detecting , then abruptly pick back up again 
mouse seems to stop 
moved it 
it just sucks 
old Logitech mouse worked easier 
Touted as an `` upgrade '' to the M505 , the M525 has an impossible-to-use scroll wheel 
that takes 
fine-tune the settings 
trying for a while to fine-tune the settings in Logitech 's SetPoint software I can not middle-click with any reliability - instead , the page will scroll up and down , missing 
Then it takes 3-4 seconds 
hopefully not jump the page again 
relegated the M525 
have a similar model 
that is going 
it was made 
spinning , no detentes 
that does nothing 
need mass to be accurate 
then it starts `` hyper-scrolling 
it scrolls 
this is about how it scrolls 
pull up online 
n't buy this mouse 
it 's been going 
Everyone seems to be having 
ordered a lesser model a while back 
it register 
n't use the middle button effectively 
upgraded and bought this one 
n't `` lock in '' to the notches the way 
it will make my page scroll one space 
missing the link instead 
scrolling the page one jump 
owning it 
middle button keeps registering a `` left tilt '' when I try 
it should be mis-registering a `` right tilt 
use my index finger to click 
click a link 
Logitech has officially lost my business 
had a couple 
It looks nice 
packaging basically has to be destroyed 
nothing comes out of the box until it is torn 
mouse does n't release from the plastic bubble until the plastic is cut 
sizing is deceptive in that it looks 
otherwise it seems to work 
use a 
large enough to fit into my hand , I would probably keep it 
mouse 8 + hours/day for work and my hand cramped 
think that 
receiver went belly up 
just bought a new mouse 
keeping my index finger 
have difficulty 
visually compared the M305 
discovered the problem 
buttons for the M305 cover the ENTIRE front surface , so unless you put 
NOT cover the entire front part 
button is thereby reduced 
which has a bigger USB plugin 
i had hoped 
Tilt wheel 
double battery seemed senseless 
mouse will last 
Mouse lasted the entire 3 months 
i had it 
However entire unit failed before i could test 
work in a rather dusty environment , only factor 
that may have played a part 
Bought the mouse 
liked the black 
which I would have known if I 'd seen 
It skips around the screen even though I have 
It does not even perform well 
threw the packaging away 
mouse costs less than $ 
Usually have a couple 
opened it 
bought this 
it going -- nothing dead 
did everything 
Buy Microsoft mice the appear 
DOUBLE CLICK for the middle button as it does 
software DOES 
This renders the mouse useless for me as I get 
scratches on the mouse-gunk on the bottom of the mouse-wear from the gripThis is n't refurbished 
It 's used 
Worst `` refurbish 
wheel and back button did n't work !! 
One out of three I ordered did not work properly 
which were sealed 
least the package had been opened 
that was previously returned 
It appears 
shipped an unit 
Certified refurbished 
Who refurbished this thing 
It 's used 
it smelled funny 
mouse arrived covered 
it was `` packaged 
Seriously , this thing is NOT refurbished 
it does work 
then disinfect this thing 
received still had 
which makes it pretty obvious that it was never checked 
middle mouse button began activating 
alleviate this 
drivers have done nothing 
PlayStation I ordered did not come 
Son ca n't even play 
used this mouse to replace 
mouse uses one battery 
then the mouse just died 
This was after making sure 
turned it 
not using it 
that requires two batteries 
found another mouse to replace 
n't recommend this one 
ball has stopped working 
mouse worked fine 
sometimes scroll several pages 
wheel would sometimes not work 
replacing the battery 
received very poor customer support 
contacted Logitech 
sending a replacement mouse 
take photos 
which include a piece 
product fixed 
it stoped 
connection frequently Would not recommend 
Batteries seem to die 
mouse is broken after one month when I received 
window is closed just 2 days ago 
that I can replace it 
give this zero stars 
it would n't hold the battery properly anymore 
Battery died 
n't buy another Logitech mouse again 
n't work !!!!! 
thinkink the batteries were dying 
mouse looked great 
Dropped a few stars 
thing eats up batteries even when turned 
Skip it 
packing was ripped , as if it had been opened 
Then , the mouse did n't even work 
what they directed 
spent an hour on the phone with Logitech running 
get it 
Logitech is going to replace 
return it 
thing sucks !!! 
using a mouse 
loved it 
However , it failed 
it was annoying 
right click button works 
gladly pay much much more for a quality product if this company or any companies make 
Maybe Razor will make a silent mouse 
Ordered two of these , both of them lasted 
It started 
Then the middle mouse wheel stopped working 
n't be buying these again 
mentioned , the left mouse button has begun to fail 
It takes several clicks for it to register 
it will not last 
try another one 
Sadly , like other users , the left click went out 
It registers one 
click stopped working 
n't expect much 
Returned it 
it 's not 
wheel pushes in to act 
personally dislike the led red dot 
It doesnt need 
logitech or razer would make a high end silent mouse 
mouse did n't work 
It came 
optical light is on but I get no cursor 
once but it did n't move 
actually saw the cursor 
rebooting a few times 
it worked no problem 
Plugged my Logitech noisy 
who knows what 
tried a few different USB ports 
stupid Windows even tried searching 
know my way 
Shame too , was clicking it 
change this review 
mouse does not work 
mouse worked well 
scroll-wheel malfunctioned 
made item will let 
unfortunately it also decides to randomly stop 
mouse does not track side-to-side 
only move up-and-down 
returned it 
had a different brand 
it slowly got louder 
switch gave 
bump it 
pay a little more 
then there 's the wheel 
like to scroll with your wheel , this will drive you crazy 
save your money 
took my backup 
definitely has a deeper voice 
noiseless mouse gives a loud klack-klack-klack 
that needed the replacement 
company went 
it clear the sarcastic 
Less than conventional mouse but it surely is not `` noiseless '' ... Should be called '' Less Noise 
buy it either 
has almost no functionality other 
ergonomic design means it fits in your hand somehow ... wrong 
it fits in your hand somehow 
It just does n't feel like it was designed 
not assist your grip 
materials added 
tapered , weighted bottom combined with inwardly curved sides make this mouse exceedingly difficult 
put it 
unplugged it 
Got it hooked up , used it 
it hooked 
left click 
mouse looks nice 
what it should be to get 
just store it 
then throw it away when I clean 
It works great 
then it would constantly disconnect 
not recommend this 
that only works good short term 
which definitely affects gameplay 
Just bought the mouse 
how it fits the shape 
sometimes the mouse would freeze just a tiny bit 
It worked great 
it 's getting worse 
Now it does n't register 
It 's moderately annoying for browsing 
left click stopped working 
this looked 
that wo n't break 
which involved a frequent amount 
purchased this mouse 
used it to play 
It served 
owned this product 
left mouse button went from registering 
have no idea 
many times I will have to hit 
that left click 
disassembled the mouse 
inspected the left clicker 
it required some filing to flatten 
which would cause inconsistent clicking 
way this mouse is assembled is beyond frustrating 
mouse is assembled 
it no longer left clicks 
replace or return ended in January 2014 so I narrowly missed 
that will work great 
want a silent mouse 
it consumes an entire AA battery 
mouse performs as advertised 
want a rechargeable wireless mouse 
battery will not last longer 
replaced the AA rechargeable battery 
used regular non-rechargeable ones 
Using the mouse while plugged 
had it to do 
when i try 
it changes all three 
i will ever buy suck cuz 
have nice features 
program one 
issues already less than 4 months old and the middle button of the three on top left quit working 
all had some kinda issue pop up not long after i got 
the get go 
selling crap mice 
has shoddy response 
not buy it 
It 's advertised 
use it in wired mode it freezes 
use the computer 
works fine in wired mode , what am I supposed to do 
it need to change 
enjoyed the button configuration 
it was set 
save mode 
it tell 
tried a few different settings , making sure that it was set to power save mode , yet 
wanted a wireless mouse 
what I expected 
it 's worked great 
biting the bullet 
buying the G900 Chaos 
it uplugged 
using it 
Got the mouse 
far everything seem to work 
i am using it on my laptop so if it 's ever low i can just plug 
rate it a 3.5 out of 5 because of how annoyingly sensitive the scroll wheel is 
wheel is just getting worst going 
i use it 
scroll would scroll by itself again 
once i release it 
even started the habit of scrolling than putting 
adjust your reading position 
that i had to return 
everything else works fine on this mouse since i have gotten 
mouse worked fine 
then the mouse started to lag 
Eventually the mouse stopped working 
it did work when I plugged 
random scroll commands constantly 
wheel randomly activates 
When playing games 
n't return this 
bought this 
buttons on the G700s have very little `` feedback 
Waste of money , really disappointed 
only had this 
returning this one 
what brand i will go 
i must have received a lemon 
middle mouse click that 
had the g602 
owning it 
middle mouse button has stopped clicking 
Probably wo n't buy another logitech mouse 
Software makes this hard 
bought the mouse because I wanted 
give it 
program each and every button , including creating 
only get a few hours 
it does not actually display 
often it just shows 
see the battery level if you open 
turn off the mouse and turn it back on , then it will display properly 
turn it 
Battery barely lasts 
went to unplug the usb receiver , it was physically stuck 
thing would not come out 
entire guts of the electronics of the receiver came out before I was able 
it physically locks 
have the G604 
what I have 
it was going to be like it is then I would have never bought 
not recommend this mouse 
Consistently `` forgets '' profiles 
refuses mouse key inputs 
restart is a massive inconvenience 
it twitches 
mouse also has an intermittent `` stutter 
use the latest device drivers 
not installing Setpoint because it causes 
not have a device 
causing wireless interference 
batteries like Mama June eats 128 ounce cans 
mouse eats 
n't mean furious first-person-shooter game-play here 
mean leisurely web-browsing 
who just finished his first bottle 
it not cure my halitosis 
it addicted me to morphine instead 
use this mouse to any reasonable degree , one must simply leave the cord 
connected all 
Do Razer 's wireless mice 
have this problem 
who 's going to find 
set it 
what I 'm going to do 
results in acceptable battery life , I will update my review accordingly 
sensor is running full-blast , taking 
one want to do 
it should be set 
Therefore , my 1 star review stands 
had the 700 
then got the 700s 
both become defective 
Just moving the mouse 
enough causes it to disconnect 
Mine is laying outside 
games forget this mouse 
one lasted 
got it , one of the buttons would stick 
Then a year later it basically malfunctioned 
Nothing worked right 
button makes 
feels like something is loose when you click 
throw it out first 
it would probably have died 
Logitech apparently has gone the way 
buy companies 
someone like a Warren Buffet can buy up all these companies then cheap out the products , while the news says 
how they made $ 70B 
that find a way 
donating money 
Robbing banks 
options do you have 
drain it quicker 
tried multiple different batteries 
then it dies 
still lasts about 2-3 hours 
it consumes 
mouse does n't eat batteries 
Seriously it goes 
Hand feel 
It lasted 
never buy another Logitech mouse again 
sensor go out 
product can have issues 
opened it less then a week ago to use 
It does not function the same way 
Logitech forcing you to use 
Set Point Software 
called Tech support 
it will not work the same 
waited so long to open it , the 30 day return window has passed 
wheel stops working 
n't had this mouse 
Well , it works 
it will scroll maybe a centimeter 
uninstalling the mouse and wireless receiver 
apart I have done several things 
Reinstalling the drivers 
it reset completely unhooked 
Taking the battery 
Turning it 
keys bound to the left and right scroll to go 
wheel will randomly zoom 
build design 
that does not work 
think its a defective unit 
when the screen auto zooms in on 
Ive had a similar problem in other logitech mice many many years ago 
that either ca n't , or chooses not to iterate 
which was plagued 
This became really apparent 
Logitech releases the next version , the G933 Artemis 
same core disconnection problems persist 
which I had purchased 2 years ago 
press the forward , lower , side button while pressing the left mouse button , then the forward , top side button also registers , even when it 's not being pressed 
exact same problem exists ... 2 years later 
this sorted 
thinking Logitech 
G700s thinking Logitech would have 
This makes the broken button 
that has to be disabled 
buttons snapping off 3 months 
update the top skin 
Loved that mouse 
This seemed to be the closest replacement option 
getting maybe 4-6 
life sucked too 
go about 2 hours before needing 
package includes a long USB dongle cable 
it died 
honestly can not recommend this 
sensor has a weaker life span 
it goes to s ### 
given me no problems 
ever owned .1 
found the battery 
bought new batteries 
usually the batteries packed in are purged 
batteries went bad 
these are using Duracell rechargeable batteries .2 
mouse still only holds charge 
last a full 24 hours 
found the mouse pointer starting to more erratically , I uninstalled the drivers 
it seem to have 
change any DPI settings or any other settings without there laggy driver software .3 
it does stop the stuttering however 
expected more 
wired , im not kidding its terrible -LRB- it does stop the stuttering however -RRB- All in all I wish 
not kidding its terrible 
mouse feels horrible 
left button keeps clicking 
whatever you clicked on depending 
press the left button exactly right , it will click twice 
issue with the left button also causes the button to randomly release 
this left button issue 
plug the mouse into , which is really neat 
fix the double click issue 
bought this mouse 
it wo n't break 
right click 
holding down the right click 
it will either not respond 
it will `` unclick 
double click when I 'm just clicking 
It will even do 
not buy it 
middle mouse button is broked 
BUTTONS ARE THE WORST 
who suggested Logitech G930 headset 
This was recommended 
just does n't suit my personal tastes 
replace it all the same 
it provides 
bought the mouse 
find the pattern 
how it felt when I was using 
materials of the mouse feel nice 
profile and DPI settings would randomly change on me even when I only had 
battery could n't hold its charge 
it plugged 
it did me more harm 
use it in the wired configuration , primarily because the battery only last 2-4 hours 
cable and the wireless capability begins 
where the wire connects 
However after a year of use the part where the wire connects to the mouse has apparently worn 
mouse might work 
have a wireless mouse 
quality has plummeted 
updates from mfg. Keeps losing 
replaced batteries , tried different USB ports 
had two 
using a mouse pad this will not work for you , also 
not buy this if you intend 
n't buy this mouse 
had this mouse 
wired mouse 
then it become a full time 
rechargeable batter quit holding 
Then it started behaving 
performance continued to be an issue 
Please email 
replace this 
that works 
opening windows without being clicked 
w keys 
started doing strange things , like spamming the s and w keys , and opening windows without being clicked , I uninstalled the mouse 
loved my old g500 before it gave 
offering the `` same '' scroll wheel 
when it should stop 
what I wanted to avoid 
as well have bought a $ 25 wireless mouse if this were the case 
it does not function as it should 
only compelling part about this mouse IS the infinite scroll wheel 
Considering the g500 
not suffer this issue 
serious quality issues going 
Alright here we go 
had the MX revolution mouse 
then my parrot cut the charger cable 
bought this mouse 
use a lot if shortcuts but too many and it will work 
say enough rope to run around but not too long so we do n't hang 
Where does this mouse fail 
old mouse battery would last for at least a month and weeks before asking 
thing needs to be charged 
had the box it came in , too bad , it had potential 
it came in 
Overall , I would return it 
whenever the mouse is plugged in to charge 
Do to failed drivers from logitech whenever the mouse is plugged in to charge my computer locks 
gotten no response 
contacted logitech 
mouse dies 
now using the mouse 
instead having the wire connected to the mouse permanently 
have driver/hardware issues 
own several logitech products

only offer the same product 
state this on the product so I would n't have wasted 
thing started out great , until I started 
??? Come 
selling keyboard/mouse sets 
keyboard misses keystrokes randomly , causing 
why would n't a company selling keyboard/mouse sets just make 
take the same size batteries?While 
Sometimes it stops working 
It will stop responding

Great Simple Easy to use 
Exactly what I wanted 
white lettering is rubbing

mouse feels good 
It keeps disconnecting 
combo for me did not function 
that occurs every couple 
messed up my wifi 
i would let

Package was missing the nanoreceiver 
most of the letters on the keyboard are faded 
purchased this 
recently the scrolling button on the top now ca n't decide 
way it wants to go 
roll it to scroll 
main problem is the keys began to fade

barely got a chance 
bought this wrieless combo 3 months back

Certain keys stick while trying 
letters are starting to wear

Also the print screen button gets stuck when trying 
mouse works well though 
which allows you to type quickly , however after 45 days the lettering is wearing 
keyboard has a positive feel 
letters are frequently missed 
couple of the keys require too much pressure when compared with the rest , so 
keyboard will be recycled soon 
mouse works very well 
then the fob broke apart as I was pulling 
it should have broken as I had only used 
's no reason 
what I could do about getting 
n't recommend this 
who does a lot 
That wastyped 
provide too much resistance to accurately type quickly 
Package arrived 
mouse synced quickly 
easily , but when I put batteries in the keyboard the battery light came 
got the same result 
ordered this product

Well , as of a couple of days ago , the picture is peeling off the pad 
Other than that I love the picture on it , it just does n't stay there

stick and numbical keys do not work 
KEYBOARD WORKS FINE 
WHY MOUSE NOT RECOGNIZED 
BUT TAKES 1 MINUTE 
paid for one day shipping 
improving typing experience 
bought this 
it simply does n't cut it 
keystroke feels mushy 
describe it 
it feels like you are typing 
it does n't provide a solid feel 
which means 
typing , letters that normally would register is now a miss 
that means when you speed 
that normally would register 
this is n't even worth the $ 15 I paid 
opening it 
still smell some 
ditched it entirely 
using a much better 8 year old mouse 
Keyboard broke 5 months later 
never used a mouse 
apparently Amazon made one 
what you pay for 
Hated it 
keyboard has no things underneath 
have small hands 
it sat unevenly on my desk until I twisted 
twist it 
it stays 
keys have a very bad feel 
this was a big miss 
better cheap keyboards form other manufacturers 
mouse randomly shuts 
loses all power 
feet on the bottom also started to come 
yellow finish pick up everything 
it goes into the yellow finish used and the scroll wheel makes 
had decent expectations 
it listed out on it 's title 
spent ten dollars on gaming mice before 
product says 
when really it is not and only has only control 
these too came 
that change 
scroll with it , it wants to go 
it will just switch back 
it came 
It instead came 
that changes it 
Still I did not enjoy this mouse 
not spend your money 
This feels solid 
why I gave it 
not make any statements 
Mouse feels solidly builtIts 
which I dislike 
have a reasonably large hands 
refresh commands boundCon 
mouse started having 
updated rating 
mouse stops being responsive 
cynaptic pointing device is off also when it comes back 
super frustrating the cursors when moved jerks back and forth as if I had a Parkinson which makes mouse unusable , as it takes 
which makes mouse unusable 
mouseI give the product 
it lasts 
give it 
have large hands 
This looked 
windows would not recognize it 
it will be returned 
things do happen 
hopefully you mileage will vary 
wheel broke 
what I paid 
it had one 
mouse felt great 
had rubber 
It fit well 
set the mouse down 
cursor flies 
This made it nearly impossible for gaming as my character was constantly spinning 
Also , the brand name is very hidden 
company that makes this mouse is called Easterntimes Tech 
that makes this mouse 
Do a quick search 
visit their website 
that would fix my cursor jump issue 
jumping issue made this mouse unusable 
not recommend it 
It works 
that causes the mouse to randomly force 
moving to the right the pointer will move 
hand ended up kinda cramping 
Precision on the mouse does not compare 
selecting small buttons 
have higher expectations 
using a razer imperator 
mouse did not come close 
posting my review , the company emailed 
mouse itself does not warrant purchase 
amazon does not allow me to return 
return it 
put it back down 
Whenever i lift up the mouse 
it jumps 
DPI works great though so it gets 
It fits in hand really comfortably 
it would jump -LRB- to the right -RRB- across the screen by at least a few inches , sometimes the whole screen 
tap this mouse 
This feels like really old day when we had 
fixing this extreme issue 
Hopefully they create a new version 
Got it 
Sadly I got the bad patch 
unfortunately I may have gotten a defective unit 
Similar to another reviewer the mouse jumps whenever you set it down , except that mine is jumping 
mouse jumps whenever you set 
that comes 
problem remained 
it seems to be a hardware issue 
company contacted me directly 
nonetheless it shows 
However this particular product does seem to have an issue , based on the reviews 
tested product 
back of it was n't broken 
It slides left 
When in use it slides to the left and contacts the plastic case 
This came dead 
Luckily I found my spare while moving 
threw it 
mouse damaged 
top it off I did not find 
bought two

Additionally , kraft-paper tape was used to reinforce

Neither one one the numeric key pads work

far the keyboard works ok 
mouse keeps becoming 
given away my Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard 
basic keyboard and this KB+M ouse combo seemed 
So bought it on March , 2015 and in around September noticing some keys are getting 
noticing some keys 
keys are not physically getting stuck though but it seems 
It is doing more frequently now 
mouse still works 
MK120 here in Amazon includes the mouse 
bought cheap basic keyboards before 
quality is going down-hill 
this is not limited 
bought their top 
having problems with it since a year ago where the scroll has lost 
got me a G700s 
G500 lasted less 
So imagine this in your gaming session when your character in-game performs 
that is bound 
now my G13 is also showing signs 
wasted enough money 
am dropping this brand forever 
not buy it if you plan

Several key combinations do not work

person not familiar with wireless mice might have trouble 
provide software 
disable the home/desktop button

it does n't automatically go to sleep 
size and weight feels good 
full charge only lasted me a couple days

Might have to reprogram 
move the mouse too fast , the movement does n't register , absolutely ridiculous 
Mouse will Not function well

getting something else 
mouse worked first time 
taking batteries 
ensuring console 
tried everything 
read postings 
Nothing worked 
never purchase another LeapFrog product 
charged half the cost 
kept it till 
it comes with are boring 
Also , the mouse does not work very well 
plug it 
So this thing does not come 
drains the batteries 
that require constant new batteries 
family tends to shy 
daughter liked it 
wanted SOOO badly to like 
got the first one 
it worked for about a week until the mouse just stopped 
computer will not work 
had a dud 
Thinking we had a dud , I returned it 
got another one 
It worked for another few weeks until it just stopped 
Nothing worked ... again 
who really enjoyed playing 
that actually works 
that will work 
receive a toy 
bought this product 
bought 2 more cartridges 
just believed the brand value 
returned this product to bring 
mouse did not work properly 
check the images of games before you buy 
recently bought this toy because I want my 3 yr old daughter to not use my laptop , also for her to also get accustommed 
involving the mouse 
However , upon first use the mouse will not work as it should it will sit 
that may not work 
live in the caribbean , so returning it is not an option , I have also bought one 
ordered the electrical plug to see 
fingers crossed 
not have bought a worthless toy because the reviews are great 
daughter looks forward to want 
it was working 
also never buy any other Leapfrog products 
whole system relies 
use this 
unit does not have an off switch 
turned it 
when the batteries are dying works irratically 
It has great educational value for the youngster just learning 
It also has an extremely limited range of levels so a smart kid will outgrow 
mouse , in particular , just does n't function well 
which gets extremely expensive if your kid actually likes 
powered ONLY and the batteries last about two hour 
not turn the keyboard/mouse off so the batteries run 
daughter enjoyed it 
do it right 
company either needs to redesign 
games leave much to be desired 
that we can find online 
it would do 
this did not make 
which I thought 
prefers educational games 
not recommend this product 
toy really should be labeled 
son mastered all the games 
recognize the alphabet 
old ca n't count 
also purchased the Nemo game 
used it 
son enjoyed this the first time 
that teach shapes 
used it 
However , the mouse started to malfunction 
cause a malfunction 
toy was n't damaged 
which requires a screw-driver 
Santa brought the Click Start system 
used it 
It stuck 
working on the mouse for 30 minutes , opening the compartment for the mouse wire and fiddling with it , we finally got it back up 
using the keyboard 
spent so much money 
had issues 
had the globe 
had issues 
that I keep falling 
charge such exorbitant prices 
what you pay for I guess 
it could peel apart 
backing on it is really not we 'll put together , mine looks 
this wo n't hold up long 
bottom part that is supposed to stick to the desk gets not sticky after moving 
that is supposed to stick 
pad no longer remains flush 
it will last very long 
edges curl up a little bit with just a couple weeks of use , so I do not imagine 
pad arrived late 
had no gel 
had such a bad smell 
It is advertised 
item arrived 
that could not be fixed 
needing more moving room 
selected this product specifically because it was a deep vibrant hot pink color 
actual item is not even close 
not open the other 
ordered two 
realisticly used this less 
it took me a week to open it once I got 
open it 
Now the sides have curled 
it 's getting really annoying to use 
It reminded 
It does not stay down 
It curls 
burning plastic 
not lie flat no matter 
edges curl upward 
curling of the edges seriously impairs the utility 
Ends curl up 
it does n't lay flat 
edges of it keep 
had one job 
It 's curled 
purple in color and edge are curled 
pad does not stay in place because after a short time , it loses 
bought the hot pink 
received a light pink one 
what you think 
beware ... what you think is `` hot pink '' looks 
returning this product 
came it was curled 
edges remain curled 
had it 
Wrist Rest 
cover has come 
not recommend anyone 
purchasing this product 
made , the back has several plastic bubbles 
n't waste your money 
Ordered Hot Pink - does n't look hot pink to me !! 
This curls 
Pay a little more more 
get a 3M 
enjoyed the pad 
later almost all of it was completely peeled off except 
where it 's not touched 
loved the padded arm rest 
where your arm lies 
pink material on it started lifting 
just needed a simple mouse pad 
ordered this 
thing does n't respond 
it might need new ones 
It started acting strange last week so I replaced 
n't get it to respond 
It does n't want to work 
consistently had challenges with this -LRB- yes , I am on an iMac -RRB- as it forgets 
n't waste your money 
requires batteries 
Note this 
Returned and got the bluetooth Arc mouse instead 
lost connectivity 
mouse had a scroll pad 
that did n't work properly 
Broke shortly after I bought it 
Few second before unpacking the scroll control did n't works 
unpacking the scroll control 
PLEASE do n't buy it 
not buy this 
buy the never Bluetooth version 
had trouble 
n't write many 
It has a very small USB connector , enabling 
rather not , the connector sticks to the underside of the mouse magnetically 
it plugged in when stored if necessary 
set forward/back/open / etc. functions 
mouse has no side buttons 
just read another review 
that said something 
% wholeheartedly could not agree more 
throwing it 
DOES N'T WORK AT ALL 90 % 
does scroll , I get maybe one or two page 's worth 
n't need it anymore 
manually move the cursor 
drag it 
That wastes more time 
product even exists 
purchased this particular mouse 
had the predecessor 
absolutely adored it 
that I never used 
It fit my hand perfectly 
never had any technical problems 
it did have one side button 
son had this 
It was n't used 
now it 's not working 
components within the flexible portion of the mouse have malfunctioned due 
n't have my hopes up 
only use this mouse if you plug 
easily storing your computer without risking 
failed , I replaced it 
which also failed 
it just becomes gradually less responsive , until it really is unusable 
Even replacing the batteries 
brings no improvement 
bought 3 
awhile the tracking mechanism starts to fade 
It goes 
not recommend it 
It literally stopped working 
looking mouse 
So , fancy looking mouse , but when left untouched for mere seconds , it turns 
it functioning again 
This requires flattening 
receive a faulty product 
Anyone else have this problem?Microsoft RVF-00052 Arc Touch Mouse 
do , do * not * buy this product 
then the replacement stopped scrolling 
really ca n't rest your hand on it without collapsing 
Second , it 's decided not to work 
sometimes it does work 
it decides 
it work 
turn it 
Sometimes I 'll pull it out 
i can do to make 
it does n't work 
it works 
pull it 
then give it a couple days 
it fires 
delete drivers 
blue light comes 
pull batteries 
it works again 
it off/on 
much I hate this mouse 
decided to make an electrical scroll that makes mechanical sounds while you use it , it does n't work 
that makes mechanical sounds while you use 
it , Nothing on this mouse works 
it costs 40 dollars 
send it back 
It keeps disconnecting 
function did not work whatsoever 
pay even $ 
tried the Microsoft driver download 
praying and doing magic dances 
Nothing worked 
last 3 I 've owned had issues 
Absolutely loved this mouse when they first came 
wheel/pad stopped working 
recieved my mouse 
plugged the USB receiver 
it worked fine 
tried new batteries , different ports 
it seems as if the mouse is not connecting 
computers recognize the mouse as `` ready 
receiving this mouse , the scroll wheel functionality quit working 
that has been stated 
This seems to primarily be a problem 
that does not address the issue , specifically 
answer is found 
issue resolved 
that used the troubleshooting guide 
however Microsoft insists 
is no solution to this problem , I can not recommend this product 
functionality should be considered integral 
still return this 
returned it 
Mouse had a great deal 
Looked like someone used a black marker to cross 
liked it 
now my right mouse button is totally shot 
miss the old folding travel mouse 
i was constantly having to restart the mouse because it 's not work 
that i bought this device 
one definitely looked like it would fit 
However , I have had issues 
now had this mouse 
product works well when connected 
now has a Link 
This being said 
have a surface Pro4 
had it 
link this directly to my computer -LRB- if so I would give 
there seems to be no way 
hold it 
only has a magnetic piece 
Opinion , if you have bluetooth on your computer do not buy this 
that does not have bluetooth tech 
have an old laptop that does not have bluetooth tech , this will work well 
Horrible , needs a new set 
retractable flattened position 
positives end there 
It takes some time to get 
times freezes 
it unfreezes 
mouse no longer folds 
that is not covered 
amazon does not service this product 
Supplementary depart ... still holding 
who said 
returning the defective product except there is 
ship it 
warranty clearly states the guidelines 
always used Logitech products 
liked the retractable feature 
already determined the mechanical rate 
Logitech will make one 
then the touch scroll stopped working 
it went nuts 
n't stop a couple times 
give this a 5 star review 
using it 
then the scroll area would stop functioning 
movement would become very jagged 
it would be working normal 
problem persisted 
then bending it back to get 
eventually gave up hopes 
squishing the mouse down 
movements are incredibly jagged now and it is very hard to make precise movements and clicks , rendering 
first one I purchased last year , worked perfectly 
suddenly in June it just stopped working 
So I bought another one 
it 'd only work about 10 % 
now it stopped working 
changed the batteries 
working every few hours so I have 
mouse suddenly stopped working 
happened to the mouse or the Bluetooth piece it just stopped working 
push it 
left button on the mouse gets stuck 
Was malfunctioning right 
owned this item previously 
loved it 
received a faulty product 
Kept disconnecting and the scroll was intermittent 
Read many reviews 
maybe it will work 
Delete drive reload nope 
turn it 
it works maybe 2 % 
feature of a mouse is scrolling 
use an old mouse 
this would work 
scroll works about 10 % 
n't buy it 
how Microsoft put their name 
it will stop working 
scroll will also get stuck 
Mouse bearly works 
scroll moves 
use my almost dead logitech mouse 
looking junk 
mouse folds flat 
functionality of this mouse has not at all lived 
mouse constantly lags 
has too many tasks 
however I have no problems with any other apps or hardware so I can only conclude 
It 's feels 
that I have ever owned 
stars or I would have 
give it 
it work 
it has stopped working 
disable mouse acceleration 
carry the usb part 
thing works less than 1/2 the time 
It does n't ever feel `` stuck 
it just wo n't work 
Super frustrating 
wheel works 
ergonomics leave much to be desired 
it to click easily 
Also the scroll surface thingy has a couple 
using Win8 
n't throw out the box so I could return 
when I bought it 
hardly use my computer 
Now , after having it for about 8 months , it EATS my batteries 
put brand new batteries in it 3 times in a week as they will not last 
Also , sometimes it will not scroll 
mouse stopped working 
functionality completely stopped 
left mouse button started having 
buttons work well 
double-tab on the top or bottom of the strip is suppose to perform 
double-tab in the middle of the strip enables a page auto-scroll function 
page will scroll wildly 
scroll disabling occurs as frequently 
mouse handle 
bending it back 
scroll can be re-enabled by flattening 
This will probably shorten the life 
concept is find 
mouse should be priced 
when the mouse fails 
support needs to be honored 
Buy the Habor 2.4 G Wireless Mouse 
not get a replacement 
scrolling is not working 
It does not move 
It overshoots and misses my mark 
that shows precision 
really need a mouse 
then I will be buying something different 
likely endure this 
Same issue started happening 
think Its poor quality 
miss type 
anything seems 
had one 
that I had 
Sold it later 
it now , had to keep 
Then had a arc touch bluetooth 
skipping pixels when moving 
Decided after the Bluetooth fiasco to get the version that has the receiver , guess what 1 minute into using 
scroll just dies 
that has the receiver

previous mouse with the receiver was lasting for few hours at 
got the Lenovo N700

run out you can charge it enough 
have a couple high end gaming mice 
cursor starts to skip 
It does n't slide across my neoprene mouse mat as smoothly 
Subjectively , the shape feels terrible 
which you would think 
it does n't feel right 
how anyone could use it otherwise 
have big hands 
claw grip 
that felt worse 
used other mice 
n't really see the value 
how this mouse will really scratch your itch 
have a mouse 
It only supports a limited subset 
simply configure buttons to do the same things more reliably , comfortably 
already have another wired mouse/keyboard 
probably kick it 
that comes

It sometimes does not work 
Everything just hangs 
Then it works again .3 
surface acts somewhat as a touchpad , sensitive 
had this mouse for 4 months now 
It 's paired 
have to regularly unpair it , reboot 
tossed this 
products do not work 
not waste your money 
screen disappears 
It you move 
having the mouse 
mouse has no scroll feature 
charge the battery 
dies , the mouse can not be used 
plug in is on the bottom of the mouse , just hope to keep 
it charged

Charge lasts about 3-4 weeks , even if you do not use 
n't use it 
it still died 
correctly , you can not use the mouse while it is being charged 
mouse turns off while being charged 
genius thought

typical mouse battery will last 
DO N'T BUY THIS MOUSE 
Using this mouse 
wanting one 
finally got one 
felt all types 
mouse -LRB- $ 20 -RRB- feels better 
use swipe features 
pad does not work so no ability 
it wo n't charge 
received the mouse 
later it malfunctioned 
holds battery forever 
It does not feel good 
it wo n't even charge 
how to contact the seller at this point because the return window has long passed 
mouse appears to be in new , unused condition 
it has been plugged 
shows no signs 
exchange it 
that works if that is possible 
it is not working already 
only had this mouse 
how do I scroll my web pages 
return it 
so take this as you will 
gestures/motions work better 
spent 75 bucks 
regular mouse ca n't handle 
springs for the right click suddenly stopped working the day after the return window closed 
size does not fit the hand 
It does n't have scroll 
work done 
stole my husband 's very basic PC mouse 
what this mouse did 
nothing seemed to work 
doing some word processing 
buy pretty much anything 
planing on using the mouse to do work , save some cash 
product but longevity sucks 
bought it 
it has n't been holding a charge very long 
now it wo n't work 
which I ca n't even figure 
vendor here on Amazon refers you back 
expensive should last 
Had it for almost a year and now , it suddenly died 
connecting it directly 
not use it if it 's connected 
It does not charge past 0 % 
design is so creatively done 
battery will give 
Therefore , the whole product ends 
one could replace the batteries when necessary 
always use lithium batteries because they are much lighter 
hate it 
It worked wonderfully until it needed 
admit !! 
Sadly , it wo n't take a charge now 
that came 
missed the return/exchange window 
Received a magic mouse 
bought this on 8/7/2016 , today 9/14/2016 , this mouse dead 
n't pair with my iMac any more 
It did not work any more soon after I bought 
item does not work 
now I have an $ 80 paperweight Since I travel 
It does not charge 
missed the return deadline 
it took me a while to get 
had my old one back 
how apply the warranty 
bought this mouse 
doesnt charge please help 
opened doesnt charge light 
means its fabric damage 
Received a used mouse , very disappointing 
who got a dud 
happy can not scroll 
it still did not work 
got the update 
bought this mouse thinking 
it would be 
bought this mouse 
showed up to my house , I opened it 
it did not work 
need OS X 
trouble shot everything 
called Apple one more time 
mouse had a bad battery 
send me a new one 
Apple obviously sacrificed usability 
So not buy this mouse 
longer return it 
Unfortunately , I 've had the mouse 
mouse only worked 
then it became intermittent 
return or obtain a replacement 
have the magic-mouse one 
how it could `` run 
it can be charged 
turned on when the lightning cord is plugged into it to charge , it may decide not to charge 
it works very well 
return this overpriced mouse-shaped track pad 
mouse would not work 
How do I do that 
replaced it 
it has gestures 
using it 
batteries last a while 
giving it another week to see 
like it enough to keep it 
Mouse would not charge 
gave it a few days of use before returning 
gesture completely or you assign it a Keyboard Shortcut 
map the gesture 
where you lock it between your thumb pad and pinky so that you can swipe 
This has nothing 
that it makes it very uncomfortable to use 
ever used a good high-quality mouse 
how to get the thing 
many tries to even get 
it recognized 
It took 
have no clue 
much charge it has 
it wo n't recognize it without having 
it is charged or not or how much charge it has unless the computer is recognizing 
bought this mouse 
it feels great 
it very frequently goes `` totally wonky 
it goes 
When this happens 
have two options 
that I know 
Mac or I can wait 10 minutes for the friggin ' thing 
regain its senses 
Come to think of it , there 's a third option 
replacing the glamorous Magic Mouse 
it even comes 
have a reliable mouse 
sacrifice a port 
locate a USB hard drive too close to the MacBook Pro , radio interference can cause wireless peripherals to misbehave 
So , I moved all of my USB hard drives at least 3 feet 
instructions told it 
not know this until the package was open 
prior to el capitan 
ordered 2 
both as neither one of them worked !!! 
not charge so there must have been something wrong 
it could move 
connected the mouse 
However , I could n't get any 
consulted a apple tech online 
Magic Mouse 2 will not work 
see additional complaints

Now I have the joy 
saving money

bought this keyboard and mouse so that my son could use 
However we had a lot 
it did not do a lot 
that I use everyday for cutting 
that I have ever sent back because I really did n't like it 
product really sucked 
mouse and keyboard disconnect regularly 
only received the mouse 
never got the keyboard

then that the mouse works great 
ordered this 
sent only a mouse 
chatting with Amazon customer service , I ordered it 
get the keyboard 
got another mouse 
key board does not work 
pair the mouse 
together it does not work 
it works 
it works 
usually bash something 
really even write a review 
had a few issues 
It will go in and out of connection like the batteries are dying 
This happens while the mouse is less than 2 feet 
tried 3 sets 
Keyboard has a similar issue 
using the keyboard 
tested the Mouse 
using it 
running Windows 
using it for basic typing you can not tell it 
running Windows 
negative effects seemed to happen 
locate my product 
products did not need drivers 
system should have one 
it works 
set did come 
that might of had drivers 
keyboard feels really great while typing 
thing works great 
doing nothing more 
really have nothing good 
trashed it 
not test the keyboard 
had it to do 
not have purchased this item 
bad one and others might work better 
buy any more 
keyboard would not register input 
UNIT WORKS FINR FOR FEW DAYS THEN IT CAME 
DOES NOT SHOW ANYTHING 
actually expected the wireless keyboard to be a lot more solid 
got a cheap looking product 
it takes up less space on my desk and keyboard tray than what was replaced 
it does 
what it is intended 
keyboard and mouse had all the features 
keys had to be pounded 
others got stuck every time 
retuened the set 
navigating windows OS 
n't put a mouse in it with power cords when the laptop is in the case 
put my laptop in , then the mouse and power cords 
then could not zip the main compartment 
it digs 
it broke 
used this bag occasionally 
have a Mac Book Pro 
strap broke 
broke and my laptop fell 
what I expected 
pack the mouse 
picked this product 
product broke a few weeks after I got 
long strap completely broke 
laptop dropped 
off , it has a yellowish tint 
mouse worked fairly well 
it still works , sure 
which I have managed to live 
middle click completely gave 
still work most 
click is different 
gross , mushy presses 
that give almost no helpful feedback 
had no idea 
find people 
making similar claims 
it would get 
It takes a minute to kick in after booting , sure 
why there 's no way 
store a profile 
plug it back in before it 'll register 
It does 
Which does n't happen 
which baffles 
leave it 
value appears the same 
it raises 
it feels 
Might try out Logitech , next 
give it a go 
G600 seems to be highly recommended 
mainly played MMOs back then 
had about 3 nagas 
each lasted a very long time for 
that feels good 
where this mouse falls flat 
it just feels way too big 
Maybe it is just because I 've used the naga 
heeded the many reviews 
it is more bother than it is worth 
Engine fails 4/5 times 
computer and 1/5 times the mouse does not work 
regret my purchase 
n't have a hope 
that is needed to support 
consulted the Corsair Support 
manage the hardware properly 
that needs a software 
done that several times , other than encouraging me to simply reinstall the software they propose not a single iota of help to support their device and I will not be purchasing another Corsair manufactured item that needs a software to manage the hardware properly , Razer can do that properly even though I do n't have 
other than encouraging me to simply reinstall the software they propose not a single iota of help to support their device and I will not be purchasing 
propose not a single iota 
support their device 
Corsair manufactured item 
wheel was going out so I decided 
had a Razer Naga 
husband had been hearing good things about Corsair gaming mouses so I decided 
read the reviews here 
n't fixed it 
Corsair knows 
What happens 
mouse will just stop working 
Ca n't click , nothing 
This happened 3 times 
sent it 
packed this horrible thing 
bought a Razer 
issues figured out I was happy 
had better mice 
that I bought 
side buttons feel 
It feels cheap 
lucky will actually send the input 
it 's overpriced 
has unresponsive buttons 
light for your thumb is blinding 
n't turn it 
program required for this mouse to ` work ' is broken 
that is permanently connected 
It 's braided so terribly 
it drags 
always tugs the mouse one way or the other so your accuracy is going 
mouse does n't glide 
it feels 
colors look the same 
want a dark purple or a light pink or anywhere in between you better just want red because that 's all this mouse 
it has the full color wheel 
picked up dog droppings 
ever put my hands 
DR do not buy this mouse 
Corsair really dropped the ball 
build quality 
requires a repair 
companies like Razer allow these buttons to act 
that have issues 
it does n't look like it has gotten 
rather use a mouse 
that runs this stupid thing 
Do yourself a favor 
has no technical support available 
it thinking 
n't use it 
it actually made 
lag balls 
driver of the mouse takes up sooooo much bandwidth 
had the Scimitar a week , coming 
buttons do not always work 
restart of the PC returned the function 
uses the profile 
forums shows 
this seems to happen 
miss on-board settings on my G600 and G500 even 
Resting my thumb on the mouse-pad looks and feels like it 's between key 1 and 2 , but I only seem to hit # 1 when pressing .4 -RRB- Sliding the side keys full forward is 1/2 key 
which already has back lights 
DPI adjust 
software looks like could be powerful 
wheel seems extra 
bright enough to blind someone .6 -RRB- The side keys have a little texture 
Thankfully you can adjust it 
that corsair has released 
mapping the number keys 
This causes the number buttons on the side to not work 
purchase this mouse 
Corsair has yet to comment 
have very mixed feelings 
moving the thumb pad 
how it `` feels 
it looks 
say medium gaming load 
However only 2 months in to usage -LRB- I would say medium gaming load -RRB- , the left click 
nothing happens because the mouse did n't want 
it registers 
Sometimes it completely misses left clicks 
otherwise I risk moments of frustration where I click 
that I basically , for now , swapped to my cheapo replacement mouse until I can figure 
what to replace it 
healthy during it 's first two months I did n't have a single complaint 
simply be picking the key you wan na bind , then hitting 
Changing binds 
create specific actions 
it just comes 
who got the bad model 
that effectively makes the mouse unusable 
setting keys/binds/colors 
it would n't replace my aging Logitech G600 
it feels terrible 
buttons feel mushy 
what your pressing 
upper buttons feel okay 
middle mouse button does n't actuate evenly , instead tilting 
adding cost 
need the extra buttons 
had a Razer Naga 
mouse is still holding 
found the scimitar 
really say this 
check the forums , big thread 
likely be returning this 
spent much 
PC comes 
had the same software issues 
already returned one , because the 4 and 7 side buttons were sticking 
chose this mouse 
nicely spaced buttons too 
Corsair gets it together 
has a unique function 
used a naga and I recently purchased a Roccat Nyth , neither have the issues 
recently purchased a Roccat Nyth 
scimitar has 
recommend BOTH 
found the software 
issue fixed 
decide to return the mouse , I 'll edit this review 
add a +1 
find an easy workaround that is n't annoying , I 'll post it 
Here 's the edit so far 
Issue with software persists 
hit `` repair 
reinstalling the software 
leaving the default profile -LRB- untouched -RRB- as the main and switching to my customized profile when I start 
far I have had success 
restarting my PC 
it fits my hand well 
tell you guys 
it work out 
having the same problem exactly what I did 
what made 
it brings more attention 
it will still register like its making 
buy a g502 
Just save yourself some time 
know two stars 
now to find a new one 
buttons seem to work 
feel mechanical -LRB- no idea if they are or not 
It makes it easy to accidentally hit 
much prefer a convex shape 
right mouse button is bordered 
it comes up flush 
This means when you click 
right click finger 
it was really starting to hurt 
playing World 
that really irked me at first 
use a Naga Molten 100 % 
have no special software installed and use a Naga Molten 100 % , not so 
Obviously I am returning this mouse 
find an adequate replacement 
who makes great products 
CHECK your mouse if you decide 
it works as 
plug it into your PC to ensure 
paying a good $ 60 -LRB- Lowest price its been to date -RRB- - $ 80 bucks for this mouse , so you should expect 
This is not a knock 
Black Corsair Gaming SCIMITAR MOBA/MMO Gaming Mouse has some serious quality control issues 
mouse itself feels great 
Corsair needs to honestly take 
how these mice are made 
first mouse I received had an issue 
unlucky , I requested a replacement 
second one had an issue with the wheel -LRB- Loud , clunky noises -RRB- , braided cable seemed as if it was picked at slightly , and area where the cable and mouse looked as if it was not fully sealed/attached , compared to the first one 
braided cable seemed as if it was picked 
where the cable and mouse looked as if it was not fully sealed/attached 
requested another replacement 
charm , correct 
think the third 's time 
3rd one looked ` okay , ' aside 
then I unwrapped the cable 
braided cable had massive damage 
pointy hard things coming 
protruding out more 
wrong with these mice?After speaking with Amazon , I had the option 
get a refund 
try a replacement 
planets must have been aligned in order for such bad luck to happen 
it looks like it was carved 
n't have had issues 
It 's really upsetting 
keeping one 
this steer you away from Corsair products , as their keyboards are nothing BUT amazing 
Again , if you get this mouse , inspect it , the cable 
it works 
Hopefully you get a good working one 
Amazon will have no issue 
what it says 
mouse was supposed to be a Logitech 
mouse has 2 side buttons , but they can not be programmed because Windows 10 can not deal with this mouse and displays error messages , although I could adjust 
displays error messages 
It only worked appx 25 % 
it works 
tested this 
not use this item until I can afford 
not use this 
Poorly made product , wish I new it would n't work , even if it 's a well known company 
it would n't work 
it prompts 
use the software 
taking advantage 
Wacom should sell used cars 
have a USB port located 
Also , I can not successfully register my product 
i get an error about trying 
what I needed period 
needed an electronic whiteboard 
do that far more easily 
using my fingers 
Wacom should look into switching between colors and pencil modes much more ergonomic 
Most of all , the stylus appears to be model-specific 
happens often with me , I have no option 
purchase the whole set again

Otherwise it was still functioning great 
chose the OfficeTec Wireless Keyboard

what I was expecting 
what you pay 
Got another razor so I could actually see 
window closed 
keys stopped working 
this but the left mouse button stopped working 
see the keys 
went and purchased a higher quality mouse 
it cost me 3 times more 
keyboard had a cheap feel 
take a beating 
mouse did not hold 
DO N'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE 
blue one with TERRIBLE quality !!!! The picture of the item does n't even come close 
bought a BLACK mousepad 
now it has some sort 
mentioned , this pad no longer has gel inside 
It 's made as small 
make it 
massive hands and the surface feels tiny 
paid $ 9 
It does not have a pleasant smell 
pad started out great 
where my wrist is supposed to go 
pad provides no wrist support 
n't buy this product again 
purchased this product 
that I got 
bought it 
it works 
mouse does n't work 
had the same pad 
had the same problem 
mouse stopped working 
rest is not filled 
never buy this again 
now its all squeezed 
wont recommend getting 
it should be 
It works ok 
black is hard for mouse to see 
Makes mouse choppy 
part did n't feel 
that reminds 
made a sound 
It feels half full 
when you move your wrist 
previously purchased both a gel keyboard 
poking a hole in the mouse pad to play 
not contain gel 
that I just received 
even rest my wrist 
squeeze it or even rest my wrist on it , it pops like it has 
that theirs had `` foam 
heeded previous reviews 
receive a good one 
ends raise up depending on the movement 
covering on the mouse pad is very uncomfortable , causing 
mouse does n't run smoothly 
how I know ?? 
it raises my hand so much 
that supports your wrist 
longer rest my palm 
accustomed to using a mouse with just your fingertips , I would find a different product 
recommendation is spend a few more dollars 
read the reviews first 
support raises my wrist/palm 
that barely allows my palm to be in contact 
wrist actually hurts more from using this product because my mouse is on the flatter side 
basically have two choices 
former gives me cramped hands 
hurts my wrist more 
makes some sort 
Belkin used to make 
inform others as 
Keeps hand from getting 
have an old Belkin mousepad 
one lasted 
this feels really cheap 
nylon has snagged 
it 's almost as though it deflated into the shape of my hand when my old one always held 
pad has lost its support 
padding inside quickly wore 
now where my wrist wants to lie 
Whatever is inside has seperated 
spot '' will not go away 
pile it 
changed the inside 
It provides no wrist support 
These used to be my go-to mousepads 
feels like newspaper scrunched 
made the foolish mistake 
not reading the comments before buying 
assumed Belkin 
that I found out I was very wrong 
What the other reviews say 
not give way to your wrist as a normal gel pad would 
It also does have a horrid scent 
pad should be removed from Amazon entirely 
THAT 'S 
reviewers said 
read the reviews 
which for me defeats the whole purpose anyway 
It also has a considerable dip 
builds up static electricity 
causes cramps 
Threw it 
mousepad I have at work has a thicker rounder pad portion 
Good price , gel pad does help 
quality of fabric and rubber mat on bottom seem to be fine 
portion of pad feels much more stiff 
that conforms 
It does not have a cushioning effect 
square angles of the raised portion do not feel comfortable 
changed this mouse pad 
It used to be filled 
still advertising it 
Definitely should have heeded the warnings 
pad made my wrist pain worse 
used past versions 
which becomes hard 
hurts the hand 
It is filled 
both are filled 
sell a REAL gel pad 
purchased a black 
ordered this product because I wanted 
tracking of the cursor cuts out constantly 
buttons can be clicked those work 
this happens every few minutes 
mouse is still connected 
not move the cursor 
move it , the cursor has no precision , forget 
taking it home at the sellers request to test 
thought this may have initially been a defective or damaged unit but after taking it home at the sellers request to test it on other devices I believe it 's more likely that the wireless signal is not capable of working if it is in proximity of other wireless devices , something 
it gets recognized 
forward and back buttons can not be used 
what leads to me thinking 
tracking of the cursor here seemed much more accurate 
this in the information but this is actually a rechargeable unit , I consider this a big drawback , I use rechargeable batteries in everything in my home , it 's especially important with a mouse , being 
use rechargeable batteries 
n't consider this necessarily a flaw in the design , as much 
that should have been disclosed 
product took a month to arrive 
when it did 
box was was badly caved in , the mouse though did not appear 
product was very poorly packaged 
ask me to try different things with it , use different devices 
change the batteries 
want to try an ergonomic mouse I have to believe there are better options out there , I would n't use this product even if it was free 
it connect 
it constantly drops 
Spend a couple more bucks 
get a better mouse 
just threw this 
making unintended clicking 
just bought another 
which I 've used 
Used it with my lap top , never really worked that 
CD has a virus 
Manual & CD mentions different company name 
gotten a malfuntioning mouse , because when I was using it , the left button spasmed 
it did n't work 
It skips a lot 
it keeps glitching 
promises a great feature 
it freezes 
mouse looks great 
mouse just stops responding 
mouse wo n't respond 
Also , at times it will freeze while scrolling 
page/document will keep scrolling 
which dpi I left the mouse on 
It remembers my settings 
i see a different dpi 
i restart my laptop 
mouse is not working

it freezes every couple 
when I click a button

it has 
mouse also does n't respond well to my mouse pad or table when I had 
offered a refund 
have a very responsive team 
added another star 
it really messed 
so in order to use all the features 
that comes with it is not Mac friendly 
need a Windows machine 
only use the right 
that really does n't bother 
fact its software is n't designed for Windows does n't negate the fact 
hardware just does n't support precise scrolling 
software is n't designed

took a long time 
it seems 
need a wrist pad 
replace my aging Logitech 
this is so clearly modeled after 
Unfortunately it just does n't live up 
it just does n't glide as smoothly 
meaning that it just does n't glide as smoothly , it collects junk 
tracking movement 
it drags worse when it does 
Logitech does n't make one the quality 
that barely still works 
that is getting a bit dicey 
n't be buying the second one 
that I was considering 
It 'll sit in the spares drawer until needed 
bought this 
really liked this 
trackball lasted well 
wheel stopped working 
contacted the seller 
that you ca n't support 
n't sell things 
bought this to try 
which had great ergonomics 
which I must admit 
one does not fit my hand nearly as well 
initiate the click 
just resting my hand 
left button does not have that problem 
It seems to get stuck when using 
ball still rolls 
pointer does n't move 
Constantly popping up a menu 
It looks and feels cheap 
scrolls smoothly left 
never buy another Sanwa product 
When Logitech stopped making 
have big hands 
it still seemed too big 
loves it 
gave it 
So there you have it 
mouse setting 
CA N'T always adjust your mouse settings 
So if you frequently want to use this with multiple systems , it 'll drive you insane 
light -LRB- showing activity -RRB- will keep turning 
use it again 
It goes nuts 
Spinning the trackball 
maybe going the wrong way when you just request 
it start scrolling 
go PAST 
reading a page 
scroll-wheel is broken 
which broke where it comes 
using a good one 
pulled out my old logitech 
Take a pass 
still get one 
original Logitech wired trackball 
why Logitech stopped making 
$ 30 wireless version feels great 
saved the packaging 
returned it 
time does not move 
It works 
got this mouse 
have very small hands 
that I used to use 
not use the Logitech ball like I hoped 
turn down the speed 
far it seems to handle 
have a bad tendon problem 
it hurt 
really liked the Logitec trackball 
it fit my hand so well 
tried the new wireless version 
had nothing 
receiver worked 
buttons had issues 
using the original wired trackman trackball 
it was upsetting to say 
one looked like it might be a decent wired replacement 
that might help 
it might work okay 
give it a chance 
using this mouse 
new one coming 
It just does not fit my hand well 
it still strains my hand 
altering it by putting 
it 's just 
palm did not help 
It 's also got issues 
it 's supposed to be better technology 
that require precision 
notice it a lot 
mouse skips 
button is already sticking a bit 
definitely would not buy another one 
it 's not doing so as I 'd hoped 
it 's not functioning 
it should start going 
play some lightweight match-3 games 
it wo n't last me one 
just got works 
spending a couple hundred bucks 
n't find another wired one 
hoping the one I just got works better because Logitech 's wireless version is crap 
had new sans 
it just plain sucks 
have big hands 
Gives my hand cramps 
hold middle-click and right-click to toggle 
still never get the speed right 
even though the Logitech Trackman Wheel could n't take a flick 
trackballs should take a thumb flick and track perfectly ideally 
spin the ball 
ball moves erratically 
Installed fine , found the drivers no problem 
which means 
it holds your fingers 
hold it 
recommend that 
replace it 
now I 've given up that hope 
need any sort 
it gets close 
then avoid this one 
used a variety 
Some performed better 
where others failed miserably 
what I 've experienced 
exceed that 
That being said 
expect the 
build quality 
appreciate the wide array 
Sanwa has to offer 
entering the industry 
Trackballs have always poorly supported 
wanted this Sanwa brand trackball to be everything 
quality feels incredibly cheap 
It feels 
Ergonomics are simply not as refined 
trackball feels flat 
motion was very hindered 
smooth and free-moving , it is constrained 
It feels very oversized 
Considering this 
device would be undersized 
Americans have gorilla-sized mitts 
Apparently , Sanwa believes 
Hopefully these issues will be addressed 
product refined 
it was no longer going to work 
bought one of these after my Logitech M570 decided 
DPI is set insanely too high 
n't recommend it 
It does work 
Save your money 
get the Elecom EX-G 
Instructions provided 
owned many Marble mouse types 
It took a long time 
it jumps around 
adjusting settings 
It seems 
It also seems to get 
It has gotten to the point now 
moving the cursor around 
bought it to try 
what can be done 
anyone has any suggestions 
product , feels 
using the logitech 
poor product would drive me mad 
scroller started to give 
use the PC 
that works really well 
have a Logitech version 
save money by getting 
ball does n't roll very well 
sometimes roll a little 
It feels sticky 
n't have sticky/chunky mouse movements 
get back the responsiveness 
wireless units just were n't doing it 
people that still have the wired Logitech units for sale are asking a premium for them now 
that still have the wired Logitech units 
ball has a ding 
body of the trackball looks great 
that was causing the ball to hang 
It took me a couple of weeks to figure 
Unfortunately , the seller has no contact information , so I am left 
recommend buyer beware as you can not contact 
wheel does n't work correctly 
owning this 
It drifts up if you keep 
which makes me have to readjust it every 10 seconds , so it 's actually a bad gaming mouse 
it would have more songs 
what I expected 
CD was not what I expected , definitely will NOT be playing 
songs seem very outdated 
had the same experience 
random nature of the issue in that I could connect to my home network , selected hotel networks 
Regardless of USB-C port utilized -LRB- 2016 MacBook Pro 15 '' TB -RRB- , I experienced intermittent wifi failures when attempting

JumpDrive shows about 25 % slower read/write speeds when plugged 
Using the Blackmagic Disk Speed app 
used this I usb-c port 
It fit and looked great 
several other users were having this problem

complained ... A LOT 
noticed a pattern 
use this , you ca n't use wifi 
Plugged it in a second time , LED lights up 
nothing is detected 
it throws me off wi-fi 
It works just fine

product did n't work 
give 0 stars if I could 
Buyers beware 
USB C part of the connector scratches my notebook

Unfortunately , it looks 
see a decent gap 
It wobbles up 
Luckily , the function of the connector works 
it looks cheap 
grey version does n't exactly match my MacBook Pro 's finish 
connected , the adapter would only work if it was angled 
Hopefully the manufacturer will sort this 
get a better v2 product out

It will not mount most USB drives 
also flash drives 
It has worked on 1 out of 7 devices thus far

standard iPhone 6/7 cable fits fine as it is narrow 
adapter I received does not `` click 
not inspire confidence 
lose connectivity 
press down on the adapter a bit 
good USB 3 speed can be maintained 
moving an attached cable 
that can be had for less if you shop 
buy the Apple USB-C adapters 
So while the adapter appears functional , I would rather just buy replacement USB-C cables

Removed the batteries from my mouse , initiated the pairing 
not recommend this mouse 
establishing a bluetooth connection 
mouse has difficulty 
NOT MAINTAIN THE CONNECTION despite being brand new 
Contacted Amazon and they provided me a full refund 
found a cheaper mouse 
wheel is not smooth 
It has a home 
nail trying to open 
service never responded back 
n't return it 
retrieved , it functioned properly 
When I bought this 
title did NOT say Bluetooth mouse when I purchased 
use it 
mouse has the absolute shortest battery life 
batteries that came with it lasted less than 48 hours , I put a fresh set in and the same thing happened 
that came with it lasted 
When the batteries start to fail 
already thrown out the factory packaging for this product so I will just keep 
It worked great 
it stopped working 
then after about 3 months , the mouse would n't connect 
product worked well 
then it stopped working 
Why ca n't someone make a mouse 
that works 
It stopped working 
bought this to use 
line , it just would not pair 
it was not explained 
what it did 
had no idea 
that came with it was so inadequate 
only learned this by reading 
it explained 
how to get the battery cover 
already mailed the mouse back 
one answered when I called 
happily shelled out the big bucks 
Honestly , do n't waste your money 
mouse lasted 
now , it drops the connection repeatedly 
Mouse will be arriving 
then I really will have a paperweight 
little support information available online - I 'll write 
one I ordered had trouble 
now the left button works only 50 % 
Normal indoor use should n't cause the button to get stuck 
it starts and stops alot 
it does n't scroll through a webpage or document smoothly 
scroll on this one seems awkward 
that did not help 
leave it alone 
It feels like it weighs 
plastic feels cheap 
It gets two stars because this mouse eats 
UPDATE 5-8-2015 
replace batteries 
Bought a basic Logitech mouse 
returned the first one

Better instructions would have helped 
purchased this product

it started to disconnect 
Immediately after the return window passed 
It does this continuously 
use the mouse it stops in it 's tracks 
product does not work properly 
It would not connect 
which rendered it useless 
problems started right out of the box when I had 
how the thing snaps apart made 
running 10.9.4 
batteries in , I could not get it to pair 
some of the disk drives and other peripherals are starting to do

It looks and feels great

Avoid this mouse 
** called me at home ** 
made this review 
Amazon provides this 
where they got my phone number 
barely understand the woman 
offered a refund 
chose the refund 
sent the mouse back 
tracking showed 
it arrived back there 
n't ever got a refund 
finally did it 
Avoid this entire * company 
it would work 
Sadly it does not 
receiving the item 
This looked very nice 
so my mouse does n't get scratched 
did everything 
It never recognized it 
had none 
get advice 
posted a question 
Followed the instructions 
Save your money 
item simply does not work 
it had scratches 
batteries were n't working 
not purchase this 
This showed 
order from Amazon almost 2-3 times 
baby see 
open this toy 
open the box 
It looked like it had been dragged 
it had stains 
never really plays that 
item was all scratched 
sent it back as soon 
what it did as far 
son loves it 
what is going 
son loves it 
It was beat 
it would last because it was sturdy 
dropped it 
it would not work 
received this item 
Nothing would not turn 
Never had this happen 
flashing lights distract from what is being said 
keeps singing same song 
finger was pinched by the hinge while closing 
casing of the toy was not fully sealed properly 
item seems very poorly made 
expected , package was torn pretty bad 
some of the lights and songs do n't work 
definitely do n't recommend this product 
otherwise but I ca n't get that tune 
even having it 
kiddo ignores it if it is turned 
which defeats the purpose 
kid closes the lid as soon 
switch to change the mode has the `` off '' mode 
change the mode 
that handle 
grabs that handle and inevitable turns the thing 
Makes noise 
keeps their attention 
n't what I expected 
n't buy it again 
had this 
now and my 1yr old just does n't have any interest 
lid smashes my babys fingers 
everytime he plays with it and crys , hes 8 months old 
turn it on , a very annoying song plays 
first laptop ... '' I hoped 
not believe that 
song plays AGAIN 
usually do n't mind noisy toys 
switch is moved 
really ca n't understand the popularity 
It does n't make sense 
Pushing a button 
gets a different response 
push it 
flashing lights in the `` screen '' do n't seem to correspond 
loses interest 
closing the lid 
7.5-month old baby enjoys 
it closed 
advanced in any way do not waste your money 
daughter saw not interested 
OFF means OFF 
not keep annoying everyone 
personally think its LAME 
toy does n't do much 
kids never played 
toy does not seem very well made 
baby played with this twice 
glossiness sucks 
hand feel loose 
it looks good 
sensitivity gets screwy 
it felt like it would not last 
it had a little bit of issues with the wheel not moving 
couple of weeks ago the right button got jammed 
not purchase this mouse again 
only owning it 
made thing right 
seller got back 
new item I received is working perfectly 
update the review if anything breaks 
having the same problem 
right button has to be tapped 
product really does need more work 
really wanted this to work 
Left mouse button works

left mouse button only releases when you release

pointer goes everywhere 
sometimes it stucks 
mouse looks great 
wheel squeaked 
sent me a new one because i posted

Seriously , do n't buy this 
setting each of the buttons to any configuration even custom

when clicking it 
mouse tends to move 
it set at it 's highest sensitivity 
LED Optical 3200 DPI 7 Button USB Wired Gaming Mouse Mice 
not having a low friction pad 
use the 1000 dpi setting 
It also does n't glide too well

Awkward thumb resting pad on the left , also has a slow reaction

build does not feel cheap 
tested it on two consecutive days , playing 
Mouse has great look 
Software did not work

Left click 
also question the reviewers `` unbiased '' opinions 
returning the mouse since it does n't work 
Useless , very uncomfortable , mouse ca n't move 
wrist has been hurting for a while so I decided 
using it 
wrist got worse 
Also my mouse does not smoothly move 
thin plastic cover of this mouse pad has ruptured 
that my wrist rests on 
gelatin that my wrist rests on is slowly oozing 
not explain it 
surface of this mouse pad causes `` slips 
where the cursor briefly flies 
comfortable , this basically makes the pad useless 
mouse does not work 
moving the mouse 
it did work 
much has zero reaction 
it is making 
wrist hurt more 
using it 
looking unit 
Unit was returned 
it pressuring my wrist 
surface does n't work well 
pointer keeps on shaking 
it takes some effort 
wonder whether 
tested this thing 
Looked pretty good but never received the package unfortunately 
is stuff on the mouse pad , it will prohibit the mouse from effectively moving 
HATE this mouse pad 
other than that , feels great 
mouse will not work 
buy a cloth mouse pad 
casing had a hole 
laser skips using 
This sat too high 
it put my wrists 
it would probably work fine 
n't use it 
Mouse goes crazy 
Tried it 
did the same thing 
Way too think to be comfortable 
It did not help with resting 
mouse would n't work on it was to slippery 
it was going to be perfect

When I received this 
Pad itself does n't have much room on it to move 
NOT work

that form the black plastic part 
flimsy construction of the item means 
It continued to work 
Finally it totally fell apart

Maybe I just got a bad unit 
bought this to connect 
first one arrived DOA 
which did work 
explained by the retailer -RRB- , I experienced a fair amount of lag while trying 
which causes this issue 
original unit I got worked reasonably well , but fell apart the day I started using it , with the plastic casing falling 
posted a grouchy review 
apparently I 'd gotten one 
had the new unit 
It sounds like listening 
Included firmware crashed 
tracking down drivers 
spent an hour 
It still does n't stay connected 
n't detect devices 
it drops connection within seconds , before even one image can be transferred 
give $ 20 
n't waste your time 
device could be designed 
Completely defeats the purpose 
Came a part 
view of your bluetooth device it will cut 
Purchased this item 
n't buy this item unless they fix

thing fell apart literally 
manufacturer says 
which I did 
leave it 
First the black cap fell 
took the rest of the unit out of the pc to try to put the cap back on , it completely fell apart 
It happened just after the expiration of the 30 day return period so I guess 
it was linked 
It did install easy 
did some limited trouble shooting 
n't get it 
it fell apart before I could research 
earphones work fine 
intermittently had almost no range 
now trying this one 
it seems to be working 
ie = UTF8 & psc = 1 follow the install directions 
it will not pair 
it happens 
Tried a different dongle later 
one worked fine 
it sees 
Bluetooth built in so I am not sure 
how to test the damn thing 
TVI do n't have a Windows computer

Ca n't load your extra drivers 
USB came apart 
build quality 
Running Windows 
Took 2 reboots after installing 
paired with my Parrott headset , the headset does not work 
having similar problems 
return it if this is not resolved 
last response from customer support required extensive changes 
make this work which I am not willing to do - especially since they warned 
returning the product 
Good price , arrived promptly 
it sent 
that switches between devices with a button because if I switch to my phone & then back to the computer using this bluetooth adapter , it no longer recognizes 
getting it to connect 
n't even use my awesome bluetooth keyboard 
buying this adapter 
that does n't work right

It of course turns off again 
Also attaching multiple devices

Used it 
Borrowed a different usb blue tooth transmitter

phone had much better bluetooth support 
When I later bought a motherboard 
This worked great

it USED 
package was opened 
UPC was peeled 
take out the BT unit 
re-opened the packing 
notice the solid piece 
whole thing easily detached 
nothing was detected 
issue was brought 
So either I 'm one of the lucky in the small % of this product suffer 
Annoying proprietary drivers , requires extra configuration 
it really screwed up networking 
installing the correct drivers for windows , which you have to get off the included disc , I plugged this thing in and windows forgot could n't see 
which you have to get 
Unplug it 
read more about it before buying 
Support could not get to work 
not get Windows 10 64-bit driver to install 
Email support nice 
which I accepted 
PC can not connect 
bought it to be able playing DS4 joystics 
have 4 DS4 
rate it as 2 star because with one device it works 
cord is frayed where it meets 
right button works ONLY if I slam 
direction it 's being turned 
then it works 
pads on the bottom are placed sloppily 
wheel ca n't decide 
it was beyond used 
n't do anything 
took a knife 
Also on the rubber grip on the side of the mouse was completely scratched 
actually accept it 
not meet the definition 
restoringThrowing a dirty used item 
bought the same thing 
paid extra assuming 
it would be cleaned 
selling the mouse as refurbished 
mouse functions as advertised 
These seem to be a big batch 
mouse makes a horrible high pitch buzz 
do this now 
releasing updated drivers 
MadCat support 
have no plans 
This effectively leaves the mouse 
n't use any of the special buttons as the computer wo n't be able 
returned it 
that I 've ever used 
It has alot 
it barely functions 
Caused my hand to cramp 
needed a new bluetooth mouse to go 
avoid the whole USB dongle 
always liked the feel 
used several models 
then the product arrived 
so finding a mobile mouse 
have large hands 
tried the USB dongle 
Then tried some more 
Finally got a passable connection 
it worked well 
Then the next day , right out of the bag , it worked fine 
Then the flashing blue `` pairing '' light came 
using bluetooth 
not connect it 
Tried everything 
now have a pretty paperweight 
that meets my needs 
find something 
MOUSE DOES 
not get the Bluetooth to connect 
Lets say this , useless 
i dumped it 
bought Logitech MX 
how it works 
how it feels 
when it does work , because it keeps 
reinstalling drivers 
turning off other wireless devices 
return a peripheral 
enjoyed it more if it would of came 
This recently became my full-time mouse 
that fits my needs as 
it maintains 
not creating clutter 
it feels comfortable 
always used my mice 
using these grips 
extra buttons are well placed 
Feels solid and sturdy , nice soft materials 
mouse , functionally it severely falls short 
not thrown out the packaging prior to using 
mouse had 
that many here have experienced 
not experienced the connectivity issues 
connection initiates fairly quickly when resuming 
it fails to provided 
USB dongle also feels useless 
When I plug the dongle 
always has to install drivers , every time 
it takes 
installing drivers 
tried multiple methods 
It fails to track 
movement seems awkward 
attempted numerous settings and registry adjustments to eliminate 
it simply remains very sup par when compared 
provide a smoother experience 
owned other RAT products 
updating drivers 
Even after downloading Mad Catz software 
greatly affect gameplay 
cursor needs to be zippy fast 
hopefully I 'll have a better experience there 
Im going to tell 
have Windows 8.1 Pro 
also changed the settings a bit 
either get a mouse 
Rarely do you get one 
what it seems 
got the later 
It disconnects randomly 
that lasts 1-5 seconds to reconnect 
Theres a lag 
quality seems okay 
software works 
why I would keep the mouse 
create profiles to become 
where I 'd assign buttons to be copy 
paste and moving files 
Now it does n't even recognize its own mouse 
which makes the mouse a regular $ 10 mouse 
It also crashes 
drivers , I have found out recently , have put my PC 
name implies 
uninstalled the drivers 
support still has n't responded to my email 48 hours ago 
only give me FAQs answers 
purchased this product over a month 
received no help other 
which I had already gone through 
replacement was obviously used 
promised a return shipping label 
which I had to request 
that is not deemed OK 
then , I think , well , they must recycle their packaging 
replacement does not function 
dirty!The feet showed wear 
inside was used 
Buyer BEWARE 
how I 've never spent this much 
EVER had this kind 
write this review 
buy Razer Orochi way better 
using it 
not buy this product 
PRODUCT IS A HORRIBLY POOR QUALITY MOUSE EVER 
product is really sucks 
connection is disconnected from my laptop every 10 seconcds 
wheel still does not work well 
Update as of 11th Apr. - Ahhhhhhhhh ~ ~ , frequent disconnection of Bluetooth from my Sony Vaio Duo 13 makes me crazy !! 
mouse has very poor product quality 
ask MAD CATZ 
how you sell such a poor quality product 
feeling very frustrated 
It is disconnected 
POOR PRODUCT!The product sucks 
wheel does not work well 
service also sucks 
that I 've ever experienced 
have different types 
couldnt be recognized 
have windows 
yet then came the next issue 
also the wheel click 
what I could tell 
who use a fingertip grip 
find a nice fit 
press the button 
pictures seem 
mouse lives 
that can create some kind 
keep the mouse still as you buttons 
that locks it 
that your computer cant recognized 
try another mouse instead 
dont reccomend 
returned it 
press some buttons 
So in summary , This mouse looks attractive 
get one 
It looks 
received it 
bought this mouse 
None of my tablets or computers can see it 
battery lasting a year , thats bull shit 
use it 
put it 
use one 
thats not something 
far it has n't caused any real harm 
got a response back once asking 
heard nothing more 
Considering the price , I expected more , a lot more 
have a ROG G75 
Got the second one 
Called mad catz customer service 
Save yourself the trouble 
skip this one 
bought the Mad Catz R. A. T. M mouse in matte black for use with my Mac Book Pro 2012 , 15 '' non Retina , running 
Much of what I 'm going to write has been covered 
what I 'm going to write 
short of it is the manufacturer left something out for the device to work 
mouse would only work with Windows if the usb dongle was plugged 
when the mouse was working 
pointer was skipping around the screen when moved 
Bluetooth does n't seem to be functional 
it recognized 
times it was reset 
operating system could even find the device no matter 
dongle plugged 
returning it 
probably buy it again IF the manufacturer fixes 
Physically speaking the mouse 
mouse feel much larger 
that slides out the back 
However , the adjustable palm rest that slides out the back makes 
that went 
mouse looks and feels very precise , like there was 
It feels expensive 
that comes with it is a bit 
examining the mouse 
rebooted on the Mac side the usb dongle worked plug 
mouse appeared to work well , although I ca n't comment 
mouse seemed to work 
spent most of a day trying 
getting a computer expert friend to look 
This included 
something with the mouse may be getting `` confused '' since I was plugging 
running Windows 
unknown USB device had been plugged 
message would pop up stating 
When plugging the usb dongle into the computer already running 
one of my usb devices had malfunctioned 
driver files 
Windows would also state 
wound up being 3 or 4 different ways 
that were installed just to make 
when the mouse was n't working 
physically tracking down the driver 
windows returned 
received an error message 
recommend this 
Functionality seems to be fine 
bluetooth works 
user may adapt 
Some of the buttons felt a little 
using the `` wing '' button 
returned it 
got the mouse 
received a faulty mouse 
what I expected 
mouse felt good 
wheel felt nice 
dongle felt cheap though 
mouse may need time to get 
it worked 
desktop recognized it 
installed the software 
configure all 
have time 
mac recognized it too 
bootcamp would not recognize the mouse 
only way I could get it connected was by restarting my system 
stating unknown device 
error stating unknown device was plugged in 
it connected 
disconnected the mouse and tried to plug it in , it would get the same error 
followed the instructions 
get the mouse 
add a device 
Nothing shows 
couldnt find it 
reset the mouse 
mouse was found 
windows could not finish the pairing process 
rest were n't installed 
manually installed the drivers 
still didnt work 
mouse would not connect using 
it still didnt work 
computer would not recognize it 
orochi 2013 and magic trackpad were instantly recognized 
uninstalled the software 
reset the mouse 
then put it 
It couldnt find 
tried a bunch 
Turned off bluetooth 
computer could not find the mouse 
ConclusionI returned the mouse 
n't pay a premium price 
use the mouse between my desktop and macbook using 
received a faulty mouse 
madcatz would have fixed their issues 
got my razer orochi 
not recommend this mouse 
using Logitech G700 for two years , mainly for browsing 
that I can move with my wrist only 
some of the mouse features 
cant be used as comfortable 
throwing grande 
close edges 
where I need fast respond 
front of the mouse lifts up stopping 
flaw , when you extend it , it goes over the mouse length , so when you make a pressure 
when you extend it 
it goes 
who use very , very slow sensitivity 
grab the mouse 
move it 
Software gives you some configuration 
sometimes it forgets your configuration 
sometimes it works 
buttons are also well designed 
looks kind of funny since the mouse is small 
mouse in general looks cool 
which I had to change 
have many good things 
using it 
hated it 
using huge mouse 
Maybe all the bad sides could go away with getting 
hate it 
that I need 
see it 
know .4 stars because its a good concept that I need , I will get 
posted a picture of G700 next to RAT M so you can see 
issue with movement , cursor jerks in windows use 
had my G700 and I plugged both of them , switching 
plugged both 
ordered RAT 
have bad feeling 
paid .99 
it said 
done something else 
these for the cheap JackyLED closet light -LRB- showed 
not fit the fixture 
cord became very finicky 
it does still work 
it really did n't last much so will not recommend 
TP-Link N150 works well as long 
get similar results 
now using a Belkin stick USB adapter 
it works fine 
one thinking 
that came 
it has n't even reached higher 
it did n't seem worth 
Probably just save it 
yeah , that 's where I stand 
not believe these reviews 
This DOES NOT work 
that was released 8 MONTHS AGO 
Waste of money shipping it back 
help some 
having issues 
gave this a one star ONLY 
otherwise I would give it 4-5 stars 
download the drivers 
install the `` Configuration Utility 
it find the drivers , if necessary 
NOT plug the device into a USB port until it actually asks 
then do it 
Open the Configuration Utility 
add it 
it should be 
give you the option 
it works 
It took me 2-3 hours to figure 
had it on was the same side 
excessive heat is causing problems 
who talk 
caused me some issues 
just moved it 
adapter just gets a little warm 
Problem was solved 
not had anymore glitches 
it works as advertised 
Now I have been using it 
it picks up 100 % using 
TP-Link could do a better job 
not allow a Trojan horse 
CD and online drivers failed to allow 
only achieve 2 megabytes per second while getting 
adapter was showing anywhere 
this would work 
is no option to update or roll back drivers , all the options are grayed 
update or roll back drivers 
test runs 
note the latency jump 
It works fine 
need unplug 
however , it keeps disconnecting 
sometimes it will reconnect 
plugin this thing to regain 
windows can not connect to <myssid> 
interspersed with computer reboots - still nothing 
updating driver , resetting 
minutes into call decided 
this is best placed 
machine live 
that hummed fine 
previously adapted this PC -LRB- all USB2 ports -RRB- with a belkin unit that hummed fine out of the box , going 
ta give credit 
Maybe it works on some OS 's but it absolutely will not work 
which is not provided 
only have a driver 
also does not have a Mac OS Sierra driver available 
description described Linux 
resolve the issue of 
Returning and trying a different adapter 
it stopped altogether 
It has worked 
i could think 
tried everything i could think of , to try 
it seems 
used the Window network troubleshooter 
rebooted my PC 
rebooted the Router , unplugged and plugged back the adapter 
still nothing worked 
other phones , laptops and devices can connect 
computer and adapter sit 15 feet 
facing it 
that did n't have the drivers 
when I install the drivers 
bought this 
so I uninstall the drivers 
it work 
it was n't working at all then try 
the and I 'm using my laptop to connect 
n't even find a match 
Even tho it works 
speed give 
what it would get!Tried it 
available , that 's 
NOT work out-of-box 
bought it 
not get drivers for it , either 
not return it because it will cost 
toss this worthless pile 
that remained unresolved 
Had some problems 
that came 
Then it at least connected 
problem might have been exacerbated 
It was functioning 
unplugged it 
it 's plugged 
small green LED light does n't turn on regardless 
device worked 
has no effect 
repairing/re-installing the drivers 
computer simply no longer recognizes it 
Unit failed exactly 5 weeks 
TP-LINK claims a 2 year warranty 
asking the same questions 
read that 
this only operates 
bought this simply because I trust 
why this adapter even exists 
Plus , no 2.4 GHz means no miracast 
All failed to connect 
it wo n't connect 
once it disconnects 
Missed the return window too 
It was working fine right after it arrived 
put it 
what you would expect 
laptop was powered 
it 's my wife 's and she mainly uses 
powered it on last week she did n't have an internet connection 
how to handle it 
did -LRB- I 'm a 30 + year computer professional -RRB- , I could n't get it to even be recognized 
put it 
it could not be found 
took it 
put it 
using it daily 
day I have to unplug 
right next to your wireless router , this will work 
replug it 
it might work 
feet away from your router , find a better product 
It worked well until it died 
download and install the drivers 
it can work 
what I tried 
TP-Link adapter would not function in ac mode no matter 
What you end 
constantly drops the high speed connection 
D-link DWA-171 / RE can be made to function 
That 's why they are being sold 
HOWEVER , the Edimax EW-7811UTC AC600 Dual-Band USB Adapter , while also requires entering code in a terminal window to set up , ACTUALLY WORKS when you are done 
get 540 
have the same chipset 
Edimax claims 
which leads me to believe 
not yet received the AC1200 unit 
tried these three devices 
All of the Linux distributions I have used were based 
which is based 
running Linuxmint 18.1 Serena 
it stopped working 
it worked 
it still would n't work 
then installed Linux to try 
compiled the driver 
not supporting the driver 
either will need to go 
tested it 
bought this 
maximum d/l speed is showing 
what I expected 
which was not recognising 
i installed it 
have a 200mbs internet speed 
However it ca n't find any wifi networks to connect 
Everything else I have -LRB- phones , tablets , etc -RRB- all show four or five networks 
device only works on the 5Ghz band - a fact 
it nor any of the other networks around me use the 5Ghz band 
have no idea 
box doubles 
band it uses 
it will work 
advise anyone buying this 
that is included 
it was working 
old adapter had a very dim blue light 
i have ever had 
i can deal 
Never buy this 
which never works 
give me a number 
product works very near 
then it drops 
move 4 feet away 
buying the wireless adapter 
i bought it 
connect it 
wi fi 
it never work with it so dont 
make my mistake 
Maybe got a bad one 
installing any software CD 
tried this 
have a slightly larger usb wireless adapter 
little thing wo n't do it 
only getting 7mbps max 
Switched this out for a TP-Link PCI express adapter 
price is enticing 
take it 
n't waste your time 
Spend a few bucks more 
get a real PCI adapter 
what you pay for 
N'T WORK !!!!! 
bought this for my Acer Win Vista laptop because the Wi-Fi ability stopped 
Unfortunately , though it was pretty easy to set up , it does n't work 
setting it 
have problems setting it up , too 
it working 
Perhaps , I 'm missing something 
it does n't work 
tried it a number 
Perhaps , it may work 
this installed 
i would n't recommend it 
meanwhile my laptop gets full bar connection 
yet it shows only 1 connection bar 
im only 5steps away 
resolve the issue 
device does n't work 
install was pretty easy 
****** ORIGINAL REVIEW ************* gave 4 stars 
Unit did n't perform correctly 
performed fine 
See attached picture 
Tight fit into the port , so wo n't fall off easily 
This also makes it difficult to remove 
adapter gets pretty hot/warm 
n't affect performance yet 
it appears 
people have a working version 
it does not work out-of-the-box 
thing will pick up 5ghz connections with decent speed , however the longevity is pretty poor 
It overheats really fast 
overheating of this device will greatly reduce your internet speeds 
that will fix the problem 
It usually just needs a few minutes to be unplugged 
it does n't work 
It works 
it needs constant breaks in order to preserve 
It can work 
bought this 
i get this item 
received a grade 
reviews made 
instead I wasted money 
that does n't work as intended 
everything seem like it was going 
i bought this item 
get the TL-WN722N instead 
spend a little extra cash 
version does not support WINDOWS 
Now I hate your company 
MONEY >> >> >> 
it does 
Driver from their website does n't work on my laptop as they state 
only have Windows 10 computers so I ca n't test 
poor range , Even a cheap laptop from years ago has better range 
that states 
's a paragraph 
it does NOT work 
indeed it does not 
bought this item because my desktop does not have built 
breaking the item in half while it is plugged 
it just did not do a great job in connecting 
why I bought this thing 
page would not load 
It wasted a lot 
So the device works 
it barely works 
uploading important documents 
then I will use this to do 
new extender fails 
not support this product 
technical support wrote 
have no plans 
consult the relevant department 
It works part 
it would over heat an stop 
however this product will only work for a couple weeks before frying 
device gets extremely hot 
min of internet use out of it before it stops 
absorb some 
anyone know 
doesnt have this kind 
Go figure 
running Ubuntu 
n't compile the drivers property 
When it is working get 
have Google fiber 
thing drops packets 
connection has become so unstable 
other device has this issue 
cant make it 
People seriously consider something else if you want 
This may work okay if you 're sitting 
getting 5 mbps DL speed 
bought a bigger one 
n't install this driver 
it says 
it might damage your OS 
It worked 
this has a high failure rate , judging 
frequent drop outs 
software has to be installed 
that blinks when there is 
knew something 
it only worked for a few short minutes before completely dying 
Provided horrifically slow internet connection speeds while it worked 
not waste your money 
other available drivers did n't work 
that 's not why I bought 
It worked fine 
i have to remove 
it magically works again never TP-Link 
now it works sometimes 
worked fine 
restart my laptop 
not recommend this 
Ironically , TP Link claims to be the reliable choice 
Purchased one a considerable time ago , worked fine 
cause blue screens 
never really use it 
included software also seems to conflict 
it seems 
adapter itself is also plagued 
thing shows its ugly side 
it will work for basic browsing , or casually watching youtube videos , anything 
casually watching youtube videos 
It ca n't maintain a connection stable enough for gaming , so if you have any intention of that , then look 
Also , for whatever reason , the driver software seems to not work 
run a rig 
adapter has connection issues 
have no issues 
causes occasional BSOD 
freezes the system 
n't recommend this adapter unless you 're just desperate 
Had driver errors 
Speed was as advertised 
Also had problems with connectivity when only 15 ft away 
it died 
try the `` 2 Year Warranty 
anyone can see 
waste your time , they will just drag it 
n't update or install software 
product does not work 
it ca n't pick up a signal 
product did not work 
other computer is hardwired 
that failed 
Skip this one

that works 
waited 45 mins 
that was literally reading the install manual 
have a TP Link router 
Especially considering the fact 
machine you put it on 
It roughly lasted 
now it disconnects all the time 
overall for 8 bucks I would say it 
n't expect this thing to last 
life was cut short 
It works 
which then takes a while 
it just disconnects 
n't recommend this 
that can connect to a 5Ghz network than buying 
both of the ones I bought are gon na be defective 
it works normal 
sometimes it cuts the connection super 
unstabledo not buy thissometimes

spend the extra money 
n't waste your time 
n't expect much 
bought it it immediately started to throttle 
i get ~ 10mbps 
n't give it a 1 star 
it actually works 
fine people spend a little more 
which will work much better 
get a real wireless card 
sort of thing , but anything that requires good latency will be butchered 
that requires good latency 
It works alright as far 
It seems to have died 
nothing happens 
Nothing in device manager , tried 
lightinging took this out one week after we installed 
This did not work

try this small USB adapter to see 
That 's when it connects

one is going back 
next step is looking to replace

Eventually , getting tired of poor performance I replaced this 
title promises Linux support 
one of the top reviews -LRB- from 2014 -RRB- got it working 
open source drivers from mediatek were last updated 
recent version is dated mid-2015 
Neither will compile unmodified 
that compiles 
that will likely require adjustment 
dmesg is flooded 
connection temporarily drops 
drops do n't happen on Windows or any of my other devices -LRB- including another adapter on the same PC -RRB- , so it 's clearly a driver issue 
adapter worked 
Imagine that 
that will be made again 
so i couldnt use 
what the installation guide said 
it i did 
it says 
not install drivers 
which runs Windows 
returning it 
tried reloading 
it would n't work 
it would work because it is such a simple fix 
drops signal 
Located roughly 20 feet 
n't really leave negative reviews 
had some issues 
it could be to do 
Basically , when it is working correctly , it works well 
However , I have had a lot 
it seems 
narrowed down the possible causes 
have Armstrong internet 
all of my devices connect 
computer on the other hand , has 
lot of trouble staying connected 
have very few problems if any connecting 
have no internet access 
it will work 
reset the router , unplug 
remember , I will post results 
trying the other versions of this device to see 
what to purchase 
Hopefully this helps others in deciding 
Caused my Mother 's laptop 
finally kicked the bucket 
uninstalling this device the bluescreen-ing went away 
n't get connection anywhere 
CRAZY thinking 
router kept dropping 
tried everything 
fix the router 
what , it would continue to mess 
Chromecast could n't keep a stable connection on Wireless AC either 
using Wireless-N 
laptop AND Chromecast BOTH were dropping connections 
plugged this AC450 Nano USB adapter back 
did a LOT 
It did not work 
tried it in my laptop as well as PC in same room where I have my TPLink wireless router , only 10 feet apart 
where I have my TPLink wireless router 
n't released a proper driver 
What should I expect 
downloaded and installed both versions of software for Mac from manufacturers website after software on provided CD failed 
Mac restarts 
icon that appears in menubar has no functionality 
that appears 
Software installs 
Utility starts up , asks to choose device in Network System Preferences ; after creating 
connection , fails to connect 
stating network password 
finally get error 
update review if successful 
Otherwise it gets returnedUpdate 
appreciate that effort 
installing drivers exactly as I described 
1st time advised me to try 
Second email asked if there were 
when installing drivers 
that covered the software installation 
Copy/pasted the part 
it is disconnecting 
junkwill not work 
reset my router 
what I tried 
Stopped working and no matter what I tried , it would not reconnect 
it was `` probably going to have to replace my entire screen for $ 1600 '' after my wi-fi antenna broke 
had some problems 
this set up because the install CD did n't work 
Just download this driver 
called 24-hour tech support and had to first negotiate some language or basic competency barriers with their tech support : `` Hey , I ca n't use 
n't download it from the internet because my wi-fi card is n't working and therefore I ca n't download from the website because I have 
install that 
only option would be to use 
it 'll cut 
forget a network password 
it frequently forgets networks 
why this is happening 
it works 
It has stopped working 
again , I ca n't * really * complain that much 
it DOES work 
replacing my entire computer 
connection will drop 
not hold a steady speed even when connected 
returning this 
it has a poor/short signal strength 
This worked marginal for about 6 months , now it is jumping 
connect , the internet is so unbearably slow 
wife refused to use 
doing some important work , when , out of nowhere , I hear 
it has to do 
when the computer does any kind 
It stopped working 
which would reset the wireless adapter 
then unplug the adapter 
plug it back in , it would then work 
NOW IT JUST STOPPED WORKING 
computer does not detect 
anything is being connected 
green LED light no longer comes 
Proper drivers are installed 
probably be avoiding anything TP-Link from now 
Lessons learned 
drops the connection 
it overheats 
it cool down before reinserting 
it has been giving me problems 
only used it 
plugged it 
First of all , this product connects 
n't download something with even 32mb without it taking 
Second of all , this product ca n't take a lot 
read a lot of things without the Internet becoming 
has no connection 
not have bought this item 
majorly regret my purchase 
not to buy this item 
that works well 
get a better quality product 
n't buy this product 
n't sent a tp link 
sent a hausbell 
it the other day since I recieved a win 10 desktop 
Windows recognizes it 
looked all 
dongle does n't seem to exist 
device ever gets up 
threw it in the headline for the product to increase 
manufacturer managed to hit 
which sits right 
Maybe if you pair this with a $ 5,000 router which sits right on top of your computer , purchase an additional signal booster 
get 150 Mbps 
that is failing 
attached a screenshot 
It works sometimes 
appeared to be connected , but does not work at all , I can not even open the page 
buy a PCI-E card to do 
using it 
Tried it 
Being ocd have been looking 
Nothing has worked 
Have many years 
much am going to write 
sized adapter 
product claims to be 
However , it really did n't do much 
tested the product 
then performed some internet speed tests 
it is not responding 
always get a message 
had a hard time 
called the customer service line 
who told me to buy 
return it if I did n't notice 
listened to the Time Warner guy who told me to buy one in person , try it 
Now I ca n't return this 
When it did work 
expecting more 
highest speed connection Time Warner offers 
have a HP laptop 
that has a solid - state drive

All of the problems I have with this mouse are tracking related 
it wanders 
it has become unusable 
paid $ 70 dollars 
connection constantly connects 
Starting from Day 1 it gave him trouble 
boyfriend would probably give this mouse 1 star 
what I need it to -RRB- It does fit 
It does 
need something 
purchased this mouse to replace 
it grew 
sometimes does work 
old and macro button began to work 
Anyway , here 's the list 
which can be programmed 
Actually even standard left and right buttons can be reprogrammed

day and mouse was literally broken

Went into settings to try to fix it by boosting Y axis sensitivity and lowering X axis sensitivity , It helped to make 
tell acceleration 
what you pay 
Welp , You definitely get 
replaced w 
fishing out my old logitech mouse 
red plastic on the bottom-crap LED lighting 
blasted-like finish rubs off quickly-cheap looking 
it just flashes colors-tacky feeling-dpi adjustment 
keep lighting 
what do you expect 1 
n't , of course , and then the 1 month went by 
Save your money 
that stands 
get a brand name mouse 
it does have a nice look 
$ 10 mouse from Frys has better acceleration 
bearable , the cursor jumps up 
n't bought it 
item is poorly designed 
thumb was constantly hitting the side buttons while trying 
i would attempt to click 
time i would attempt to click i would also push the change DPI buttons 
not give this thing 
unfortunately , it only lasted 
Now when I try to use it , the mouse sticks 
not buy this again 
dpi switch buttons 
it kind of stinks that one person will get their present 
mice were meant to be birthday presents 
pinky finger is HURTING 
way the mouse is designed , does NOT fit your hands very well 
mouse is designed 
where your pinky is rests 
area where your pinky is rests on the mouse is slanted 
pinky finger is placed 
which puts a bit 
texture on the mouse over all does n't give very good traction 
which makes 
have to pick up the mouse to reposition it on my mouse pad , causes this awkward sensation while you have 
mouse has buttons 
which makes it pretty useless 
most players want to change 
lift up the mouse to switch 
that surround the thumb 
self feels horrible 
finger is placed 
used to playing with my index finger on the 1st Button , Middle finger 
playing 1 match 
fingers/hand is starting to hurt 
get a replacement 
It has a nice rubberized texture 
LEDs inside can not be customized , so it ' l 
mouse also has a protrusion 
that makes it a bit uncomfortable 
it surprisingly has the exact same interface 
also have issues 
It implies 
alter the lighting 
it is made 
It lasted 
poorly it pushed 
door also does not fit flush to the unit when you slide 
not waste your money 
TouchPad only works 
goes nuts 
n't get the back light to stay 
giving me a half inch 
that came 
what you pay for 
Range of 5 ' what do you think 
touchpad does not work

This never made it 
buttons fell off after taking

car was scratched when i opened 
it never worked 
One of the wheels was also damaged 
It already broken 
what you pay for 
cursor jumps around often when I am not touching 
It does work 
looks kinda cool 
Maybe it just needs to be on a mouse pad 
it would work good 
Neat idea , really hoped 
it 's made very shoddily 
left button does n't work 
give this negative stars 
Also there 's a spot 
expect this to work 
wheels came off 
has no return policy

It did n't work the way 
it fits a kids hand 
never seen such presentation 
Tried it 
never got a response

busted still works 
got it 
it thinks 
who saw 
wheel spins and the light is insanely bright , clicks too loudly , everyone 
wheel sticks 
it worked okay 
Loved the look 
liked it 
Then the scroll wheel started to go 
It would scroll 
It got worse until it did n't work 
got it 
light cover simple fell 
which did n't effect 
it wiggles like an uneven table or chair would 
Also , the headlights feel like buttons , but are not press-able , very annoying 
cursor keeps jumping

Now to return this thing 
It never worked 
buttons stopped working

that did not have an audible click 
one might meet that requirement 
Additionally , the construction of the mouse has a cheap feel 
it will hold

It does n't do the only thing 
not buy this 
one worked 
It does n't work

Nice looking mouse but in real life it has bad ergonomic , awkward scrolling and after 2.5 years left button is broken 
always liked Logitech products 
it hurts my wrist when I use

terrible mouse wonthold a charge

However , it has serious lag issues

keyboard works great 
which I went back to using 
so does my old microsoft mouse 
liked logitech 
bought this mouse to use 
Often , sliding your fingers across the surface does nothing 
sliding your fingers 
When it does work it either scrolls 
it just never works consistently 
adjust the settings 
it also has only two buttons 
had it since spring of 2013 and stopped using it in the summer , opting 
REALLY wish 
sent it 
received my unit 
got a full refund 
just bought this mouse 
it can scroll 
throw the package , I can not return the product 
dissatisfied so much 
use it 
treat it 
Never drop it or treat it badly 
never write product reviews 
had such high hopes for this because I just LOVE 
last Logitech mouse lasted 
made the switch to Windows 8 , it lost compatibility unfortunately 
tried it 
found this mouse 
Pros and cons are listed below 
Looks pretty awesome .2 
has a ton 
what you 're looking for 
It works with Windows 8 and has a ton of multi-functional touch activities , if that 's 
now Logitech has ripped that out 
mice have had a literal `` wheel 
HATE the touch-scroll function 
fact that the mouse is so low-profile makes it even worse 
20min my right hand felt like it had already developed 
which barely ends with you landing 
set your fingers on this mouse to make 
it feel comfortable 
have pretty small hands 
really ca n't imagine someone with large hands using 
It sits very low , and again , since you do n't have 
set it on the touch-scroll , it thinks 
returned this item 
instead got the `` Microsoft Sculpt Mobile Mouse 
has the same metro mode button 
Logitech does not offer a smaller mouse 
wrote this review using 
got such kind 
used many wireless and wired mouses before 
reading soo many reviews 
much i am highly disappointed 
what you pay for 
scrolling and Window 's 8 features left me completely unimpressed 
How this product gets the high rating 
got this mouse 
sensor solves that 
shape of the mouse makes 
it slide forward 
not buy this again 
Mouse looks very good 
it smooth 
which support 
not control whell scroll 
change it 
bought the Logitech Zone Touch Mouse T400 
only used it for 2 weeks until the small receiver part was missing 
n't have any room in the mouse to store 
receiver can stick 
which I 've been using it 
never lose it 
it costs 11 USD while my whole mouse only costs 
swiping did n't work well for me , as I could never get 
how can I use it 
bought this Logitech Zone Touch Mouse T400 on Amazon few days ago 
How can I use it 
Anyone can give me a feedback 
buying logitech products 
Do yourself a favor and buy the Anywhere MX mouse instead 
buy the Anywhere MX mouse 
well I found it to be too small 
mouse worked 
plate did not provide consistent results 
workspace is limited 
HiI bought this mouse 
not change weapons 
not change images 
scroller simply does n't work well 
mouse tracks great 
It wo n't scroll net rent browsers without first clicking 
it 's going back 
ado not buy rating 
mouse comes 
It does not have setup guide 
battery come 
highly doubt the source 
mouse set up right 
Maybe i just do not have 
not get it to work 
that simply does n't work 
palm to wrap 
It does n't have to be huge 
Relaxed human palms form a certain `` dome '' that most mice follow in shape , to facilitate 
prevent fatigue 
that most mice follow 
that makes it rather uncomfortable 
one is shaped 
Windows does it automatically 
scrolling is not smooth 
keep it 
have extremely dry fingers 
not use the glass tracking area 
that replaces the roller 
When scrolling a page 
it sometimes -LRB- too much for me -RRB- jumps back 
that uses the roller 
it has going 
left click 
mouse lost 
down-graded the rating a point 
using Logitech mice 
n't use anything else 
batteries will last a very long time 
had this mouse 
awhile and SetPoint still reports the batteries as `` full 
button '' works 
This does n't always seem to work as expected , however 
fast if you move your finger swiftly 
's no center scroll wheel 
Left and right sides are left 
which is all I will use from now 
use my mouse 
mouse click action 
rated it 
that does n't overly stress 
value your finger joints , find a mouse 
then the thing went all squirrely 
just hate a floating mouse pointer 
what it will point at 
Here 's the skinny 
just barely reach a 10th 
using the Logitech M510 
just do n't expect it to change 
it work 
it does n't 
use xp too , do n't get this 
Niice mouse but the ir sensor does not sense your movements most 
reppeating the action several times before it works 
dont mean to , it will activate sliding 
used the mouse 
replacing the mouse 
swiping your finger 
scrolling a web page -LRB- swiping your finger up/down the touch zone -RRB- , the mouse will often incorrectly sense a double tab 
up/down the touch zone 
turned the `` feature 
lack of precision in a touch zone versus a wheel will drive me back 
holding the left button down and performing an action -LRB- moving scroll bar , dragging file across the desktop -RRB- , the mouse forgets the 
performing an action 
moving scroll bar , dragging 
This does n't happen 
return this 
purchase the older model 
especially liked the left and right gestures 
never had so much trouble 
mouse just added 
finally just returned it as I could not get 
Win 8 
feature leaves a lot 
It only works partially 
that the mouse decides !! 
left mouse button only works occasionally 
It makes the clicking noise 
requires either multiple clicks and a hard press to get 
that does not work 
this obviously takes 
downgrading my rating from 4 stars to 2 as I consider 
enhance your overall experience 
not catch up/down movement immediately 
time change the page 
when click front side 
hand get tire when using 
A think 
have M505 
even use long time 
later broke the support 
i tried to get 
i used it 
it start losing 
n't recommend this brand 
returned this arm after a few days use 
using a single ErgoRest articulating arm 
wanted a second articulating arm 
purchased the eLink 
it has too sluggish a feel 
when I unscrewed the eLink 
Lesson learned 
that I purchased 
returned this product 
had high hopes 
it did n't work 
perhaps it 's not designed 
forearm kept resting 
n't wearing long sleeve shirts 
that 's attached 
arm/wrist to follow 
n't find a natural path 
REALLY wanted this to work 
ordered/received the ErgoRest 
this has worked out really well 
better accommodates my arm 
had a similarly designed/constructed arm Ergoguys Arm-stand Computer Armrest 
pad kept falling 
well it ended up making 
Also the little black thing that is at the top of the threaded lock-down mechanism falls right off 
It also should have some neoprene on the top of it to make 
which I find too much plastic parts 
which i also bought/now use ErgoRest 
the would combine some 
have a winner 
Has no paper work 
nearly break the cover 
i 'm going to try 
have a feeling 
keyboard worked fine 
mouse worked 
items feel flimsy 
crush the mouse 
have this 2 stars 
returning it 
It does n't even include 
that exactly meet the guidelines 
broke the cover when attempting 
batteries and batteries that exactly meet the guidelines -LRB- AAA , recommended brand -RRB- did not even fit 
All in all , incredibly disappointed 
it does the job 
popped it back 
button fell off as soon 
build quality 
using mouse 
who has a harder time 
Eventually got a different mouse for him since this one is much shorter 
It seems 
mention that 
keyboard can be avoided 
what you pay for mouse shipped broken and over all is very cheap 
late keyboard works fine 
mouse came 
all I can say 
Spend the extra money 
buy a REAL gaming mouse 
characters get missed frequently 
Mouse goes to sleep 
So half the stuff you type never makes it 
Mouse eats up batteries 
never leaves poop droppings 
Keyboard skips keys 
which I have tested to be sure 
not recommend this 
bad product worked 
it seemed to lag 
typing at all mouse worked good tho 
u use 
Keyboard would n't turn on after multiple batteries were tried 
mouse broke 
mouse stopped working 
button on the side of the mouse broke 
three of these and two of the mice came 
one does n't seem to work 
keyboards miss keys 
Missing pieces , mouse did n't work 
n't Buy This Keyboard 
Pay a little more 
Keyboard does n't pick up all keystrokes when typing 
get a better keyboard 
Mouse feels unresponsive most 
it arrived 
Amazon refunded the shipping 
Mouse was disassembled 
it never worked properly 
click the mouse initially 
This has improved 
Quit fooling yourself , just buy logitech 
make most 
retyping passwords 
Unfortunately missed the Amazon ` Product Return Window 
spend a little more money 
reorder a better one 
maybe try a different websites product offerings 
Keyboard works alright 
n't recommend it 
repeat , DO NOT BUY THIS 
it just randomly shuts off whenever it feels 
it disconnects constantly 
Iwen tto thes tore 
ordered 2 
mice were popped open 
Also , the wireless receivers were supposed to be inserted 
One of the 2 mice will not register a left-click 
keyboards seem to work 
some getting used 
feel of the keys takes 
It is sitting 
mouse lags , making 
Keyboard works 
mouse does n't 
as to where I wanted it to go 
used it 
got it 
then the mouse started to work 
It has never Worked 
Mouse constantly freezes 
Spend the extra money 
get Logitech 
things on line about this board say 
mouse keeps 
push the caps lock 
light comes 
it was not for that I would send it back 
put up the correct words to describe 
keys are not smooth 
threw it 
it can work 
not returned it because it 's not worthy 
what another reviewer refered 
Good luck And God Bless all on the concept and someone who is able to develop something that really worksand some thing that is palatableNO STARS ARE LOW ENOUGH 
that really worksand some thing 
not meet expectations 
not buy at all 
just threw it 
mouse was basically broken when received 
it totally quit working 
battery would pop out easily 
Product looks appealing 
It kept losing 
It works 
keyboard looks good 
test it 
n't had time 
that made it two stars 
mouse was broken 
key board looks cheat 
keyboards is very cheaply made 
mouse works well 
it works 
mouse has a bit 
it stops working 
cheap i feel 
Adhesive stickers do not work 
clip works great 
need some heavy duty adhesive to make 
it work 
USB cords seem to be too small 
Purchased these to organize 
holding the cables 
do the job of holding the cables , the adhesive backing they use has failed 
fix an issue 
put a screw 
use your own adhesive 
that should n't be occurring 
that seems 
it does n't hold 
These come un-stuck 
that holds it 
Two out of two of these that I have used have failed to hold 
that I have used 
side that sticks to the clip itself falls 
that sticks 
tape stuck 
These do not work well 
stickum lasted 
all of them fell down , tangling 
Good for few days then comes unstuck if there is 
wires come 
stuck one 
charging wire 
clips for two cables do not hold the cables very well 
regular sized USB or Lighting cable slips through it very easily 
Also , some of them have started to unstick 
originally liked these 
avoid this brand 
These suck 
hold a cable 
what they are supposed to do 
This was purchased 
attempted to use this in my car -LRB- a comfortably heated one -RRB- , it would n't adhere 
it turned 
adhesive , it turned out , had been rendered utterly useless 
that were stored 
that were purchased 
test a product even if purchased 
These do n't stay 
adhesive wo n't stick 
It works much better 
product looks very nice 
put the problem 
it slips right back out just as easily 
wire slips right 
Sticks for about 1-2 days then falls 
Hardly hold the damn wires 
not buy these 
have a hardwood floor 
throw all 
n't recommend rhem 
have one 
Defeats the purpose 
sticky stuff would only last 
then all my cables would end 
sticky pads started failing 
had difficulty 
getting the tape to hold 
Also , depending on the size of your cord you may have difficulty with it staying 
slip the cables into were a little 
found the openings 
had high hopes 
it did n't hold any of them effectively 
adhesive on the bottom of the clips would n't stick to the table or the wall either 
only positive to this order was the seller made the return very quick 
do the job as long 
using double-sided 3M tape 
solved this by just peeling 
other brands worked better 
which held it 
then the cord pops 
tried this 
not keep a coiled cord in place either 
loved the original 
old self remembers differently 
botched the controls pretty badly 
control of the character does not feel right 
made a simple patch 
simple level of side scrolling graphics was easily handled 
What are these steam people doing 
n't even play it because it was too slow 
It seems 
it did n't work properly 
once it was downloaded 
when you tell the character to perform 
controls do not respond well 
game should go back 
do it right 
horrible , that reflects poorly 
Unfortunately it 's plagued 
These can mostly be solved by running 
on/off switch does n't work 
consequently it turns off too often to be able 
batteries do not sit snugly 
returning it because it 's It has never been usable 
cursor freezes 
not move it 
not have this problem 
what I expected based on all the reviews 
what I paid 
It does n't really work that 
mouse has built 
return it 
Welp , took a risk 
cursor disappears 
Turning the unit 
USB came with this mouse , very frustrating 
it weard 
it will slip 
thumb -LRB- normal sized male hands -RRB- would straddle two buttons and press as I tired 
hand kept slipping 
push it around 
so because it takes so much effort 
returned it 
that I just could not bear anymore after having 
Has a strong cancer 
placed it back 
requested a return 
that covers these wrist 
fabric that covers these wrist rests 
it do 
It Does 
n't Get This 
It wasnt able 
It turns 
batteries pop 
it stopped working 
replaced the batteries 
it does n't work consistently 
II 'm updating my original review because I have n't even had 
already it 's not functioning 
it was n't working 
highlighting cells 
it would move 
not imagine the grief I 've had because it would unclick 
losing my mind 
n't even send it back because it 's been over 30 days 
it just stopped working 
that got crushed in my suitcase when I was traveling 
This replaced a similar Gearhead 
Otherwise , I 'd still be using the original one 
which I 'd had for about three years already 
So , nice design , works well 
keep it away 
This did not work

keyboard & mouse combo looks amazing 
It has a great color 
however , its functionality was lacking 
had so many issues 
It makes it nearly impossible to do 
using it 
maybe it would get better 
Returning this as it 's virtually worthless

screen has no lighting so it 's difficult

All you can do is adjust the contrast 
That plus a small screen makes this very difficult 
young child to see 
really liked this keyboard mouse combo from looking 
it was exactly as I expected 
received the package 
However , it is definitely cheaply made 
USB for the items apparently had a lose 
put it into the USB slot in my laptop , the casing had dislodged 
already thrown it 
then , noticed the poor workmanship 
Honestly , it looks 
keys kept falling 
cant get the mouse 
just bought another set 
it looks better 
looking these 
Luckily , I have Amazon Prime 
Super easy - problem free set up ... MAJOR DEFECT THOUGH this keyboard is bouncing 
prevent such movement 
keyboard lacks the support 
board itself lacks support 
e. the material 
KEYS ARE RAISED 
Item did work 
returned the item 
awful , I would have been returned it even if it did 
Missing the USB connector so it 's technically worthless 
Ordered gold , received black 
n't have the time 
Other than that , It works good 
bought it because it said 
returned it 
mouse was very cheaply made 
mouse only worked 75 % 
BUT , the USB was very difficult to get into my computer , i had to use 
making it so you ca n't click 
keys on the keyboard do n't work 
threw away the box 
n't take a chance on ordering it , do 
ordering it 
Keyboard works great 
mouse sucks 
mouse does n't always register 
mouse wo n't work if it 's on top 
arrived it was missing F3 key 
read previous reviews , I would n't have know some 
It only lasted 2 days with brand new batteries before they both stopped 
find a more reputable company 
n't Buy biggest piece

Mouse connected perfectly but keyboard will not work !! 
What else can I do ??? 
sent a replacement keyboard 
which work fine 
Ilike rep contacted 
Item came 
Returning this 
It looks cheap too - aside 
It appears to only last 
it kept clicking on its own when I plugged 
right mouse button did n't work 
mouse looks great 
left mouse button did n't even work sometimes 
item SUCKS 
Mouse will lockup/freeze right 
It requires me to disconnect

n't buy it if you 're a gamer 
purchased mice 
looking for decent mouse I would not have suggested this one 
rate the mouse 2PSThis mouse 
not classed this mouse gaming mouse 
button already is starting to fail 
It 's advertises a gaming mouse 
has no weight 
button broke 
leaving no connection so the mouse stops 
not buy this mouse from Ihome again 
that shuts off randomly 
loved it 
doesnt work , have to buy 
cover and space are not well made 
space for the batteries allows them to shift 
cover comes off way too easily 
springs allow the batteries to move 
This started a couple of weeks after it was received 
do the same thing 
Does no click 
move the mouse around 
then it quit 
it will click and scroll but the cursor refuses 
restarted my pc , tried everything 
i could to get 
it working 
i can get a replacement 
then if that one works ill 
update my review 
i have a super nice computer 
that can run everything so idk 
have a mousepad 
use a different mouse instead 
It does look really cool 
got a $ 6 mouse `` Aula 
has the same extra buttons 
trick people into buying 
finally got the replacement 
i 've been using it 
feels like someone really tried when they designed 
entire mouse feels substantial 
this worked out great 
lights turn off when you shut 
buttons feel extremely cheap 
lights do not turn off , even when computer is powered 
pictures show 
unplug or buy a usb hub 
used it 
i 'll get something else 
Catch ration for was 1 mouse 
one caught any mice 
Mice go in 
it flat out does not work 
However , mice do not go 
Also tried The Smart House humane mouse trap 
mice go 
steal the food 
Mice do n't even look twice 
placed it in the same place we have caught 
Tried all different kinds 
Only caught 2 mice whereas the `` Snap-E by Kness '' and `` Victor '' with the yellow trigger traps caught 
n't caught anything so far 
placed it where my house mice routinely pass 
nobody got tricked 
that was holding the trap in place instead 
one of them actually decided to chew 
i had 
s *** load 
far i have not caught any mice 
it did n't work 
it take 5 days to arrive 
mice ate the bait 
ate the bait 
brand of trap similar to this and the mice got 
next morning bait was eaten 
asking for advice on this page as to whether these were made better , I bought one 
baited it 
mice had escaped 
where the good reviews are coming 
Anyway , I have two Havahart live traps 
have mice 
far , a week later , only mouse poop has shown 
place it side-by-side 
latter catches a mouse 
Eaton sits idle 
Is there some trick 
getting it to work

why should anyone have

broken windshield cracked the 
Box arrived 
directions missing 
it did n't work 
loved this little car 
tried it 
seller contacted 
sometimes it would n't work 
That should have been put in the description of the product before I ordered 
This came with no instructions , no way 
connect it 
one included 
right click 
looking mouse 
writes cars 
mouse will not stay 
Came with the KVM in a box and the cables and box shrink wrapped 
it was resold 
USB devices powered when plugged in the Monitor did n't come 
Tried multiple machines 
Returned and ordered a different switch 
hooked it 
purchased the 2 port , I received the 4 port model , unfortunately the first time 
one of my computers would come through 
Tried it again 
computers would not display 
it only to support mouse/keyboard across my home and work computer to keep 
sometimes use the mouse 
has power 
what I bought this 
Once main computer is booted 
it works OK 
move the cables around 
product works well to switch 
it can handle a monitor 
description implies 
description says 
it works with Windows and Linux just fine 
it does n't work 
had a poor quality video 
Keyboard and mouse worked great 
This DOES 
accepts USB , your wireless KBD & mouse must work 
So , it only works to switch 
what I received 
u might make mistake 
store never sell Logitech Unifying Receiver 
JacksonJust because they do n't sell it , they say 
made a mistake 
it simply stopped switching 
Bought an IOGear switch 
it instantly recognized ALL 
devices plugged in 
Including the wireless receiver 
connected colors on display were washed 
Icons and text appeared grainy 
Changed cables and the same occurred 
tried several different setting 
Returned it 
had no problems 
not recommend this product 
ports seem to work 
ran it 
connected a 1680x1050 monitor 
It changed the resolution 
NVIDIA only picked up a native resolution 
it does a pretty good job 
keep item this purely 
running something ancient , do n't expect good video 
pulled apart the VGA and usb because I was sent 
i should upload a photo 
Also , after a month it 's started blinking the monitor display 
It eventually stops 
Mostly it works 
received the 4 port 
purchased the 2 port version 
It keeps cutting 
then it works 
that seems to work 
only had this item 
had high hopes 
it turns 
it does n't keep the monitor 's resolution available when a PC is n't selected 
goes to sleep and wakes up without being selected , it will come 
That means 
It does , however , make a perfectly fine USB switch 
connect a keyboard 
show pc 
switching to pc 2 the keybored and mouse will not work 
had one 
that had bent pins 
port does not support higher end video resolution 
item did not work 
none of the USB peripherals work 
monitors will switch fine 
have a USB mouse 
that work fine 
n't even receive power 
whole set up pointless 
Which makes 
read these rerviews before buying 
USB end slipped off when I tried 
have two HP PCs 
how I configued the attachments 
It would not accesS the second 
used USB mouse 
advice Do n't touch it 
cables are poorly made 
returned it 
have four computers 
that worked 
times I hooked this 
Keyboard/Mouse was not recognized 
it work 
It took me nearly a year to get 
Thankfully it did n't cost to much so it softens 
that I ca n't return it 
had a Trendnet 2-port 
which died a few years ago 
then got a 4-port Trendnet 
That just died 
try another brand 
which quickly tires your eyes 
Also , the monitor seems to have 
only switch PC 's by pushing 
n't require a power source 
one does n't require a power source 
Some of the other ones out there require a power source 
this helps anyone 
model i 've been using 
need any level of sophistication , do not buy this product 
Spend $ 15 more bucks 
Save yourself the aggravation 
it was working fine 
Installed it 
person reported 
switching of the USB devices began failing

using the cables 
Switch did not work after exchanging 
that came 
switch had no power after connecting 
have 3 computers 
that I wanted to connect 
One kept jumping 
One worked 
returned it 
It causes monitor image 
that makes it almost useless 
just got faulty product 
Beware , It has no keyboard hot-key switching 
Better save your money 
pay more to buy 
not recommend this unit 
get something 
spend the extra money 
that is wired correctly 
that video generates 
have a rather complex system 
hear the audio noise 
it 's there and clearly indicates 
unit is not designed well 
clearly they know that 
it shows 
return the unit if 
function operates 
cables seem to function 
image was shifted 
communication back through from the monitor to the computer seems to be non-functional 
that draw power to work 
only get one 
n't expect USB devices 
Have had this unit 
USB ports no longer work 
Definitely does not look the same 
Color is faded 
Not what i expected 
Bad quality , does n't look anything 
Just received this 
Clearly I did n't pull out a ruler 
this would serve 
Almost to where you doubt the purpose 
This caught my eye 
never returned an item 
what I expected fir 
once I received it 
loved it 
read some of the other reviews before I bought 
not recommend it 
where it looks worse 
pad looks nothing 
picture shows a very vibrant blue color 
It also has a disgusting fish smell 
that I expected 
It definitely looks better in the picture than it does in person 
It 's pretty cheaply made , too 
It works ok 
it would be 
TINY AND IT SMELLS BAD 
It looks nothing 
it does n't look anything 
paid $ 7 or so 
not buy this mouse pad 
Ugly , looks nothing 
It had the potential 
it does n't look anything 
color is completely washed 
colors actually look completely different 
exactly what I wanted 
it sitting 
It looks fine 
it looks 
however , it does not work 
Intuos has produced thousands 
operate this system 
person must look at the screen of their computer when drawing 
have problems looking away from the pencil or paintbrush when doing your art , you may have tremendous problems with the Wacom , as I do 
this may work 
test whether or not this may work for you , put a photograph away from your drawing pad and try drawing the picture without looking at the drawing pad while you are moving 
poor , then the Wacom pad may not work 
lose the money 
lost nearly 100 dollars 
what the website says 
works , and it is a computer , Amazon will not take it 
which I draw 
achieve acceptable results 
also have an Apple iPad Pro 
See the drawing 
It is just like using paper 
it moves the cursor 
move the stylist 
complete disconnect 
stylist works well 
tried it 
which does have layers 
that comes 
free art program that comes with the Wacom Art package does not have layers 
tapping did not work 
stylist moves

work at all for me I gave the system one star 
who can successfully use the Wacom 
how you can do it 
tablet did function 
which saved it 
ordered this tablet to practice digital drawing , hoping 
take effect.-The tablet itself CONSTANTLY loses track 
getting this product to function 
said drawing program 
That said 
Functionality is not restored unless you restart 
restart the computer 
mode results in complete loss of functionality of the tablet until the service or the computer is restarted 
this happens regardless 
did work , the cursor would skip around 
discourage its use 
attempted to use this product for over a week , I can not recommend it 
product works well 
advertises a bundle pack when you only get 
receive 4 stars 
have bout 
Worst pad Wacom had ever built 
constant glitches going

Where do I send my invoice to charge

1st , it does not work with Windows 7 even though it says

Dad bought a Christmas gift

MAKE THE USER EXPERIENCE OUT 
daughter received this 
which means 
installed , the Wacom website either does not respond or gives a certificate error 
Purchased this 
Still can not access it 
chase your tail all 
sign in page hangs 
page hangs 
Live chat unresponsive and phone support 
Might have to stop 
spend hundreds more 
not make the same mistake 
ones fade away 
bigger brands dominate 
's a reason 
Some match their brand promise 
lesson learned 
bought this for my daughter for her to use 
use the tablet 
STILL can not access the WACOM shop to register 
get the comic software 
that I paid 
it does work great 
registering frustrating 
save your money if that is your intention 
this will NOT work 
it worked adequately , though without being able 
key for software did not work 
it packaged up to send 
using it 
have no idea if product works 
Santa brought this 
that should 've been included 
Wacom , thank you for ruining 
1999 called

How Wacom does it 
manual says to install 
it DOES N'T 
Website must make sense 
who do n't work 
's see 
what we bought 
that seemed to reference 
So , we guessed and downloaded all 
it should work 
sliding the power switch 
another causes the product to -- well , you know -- turn 
Wacom does it 
red paint means 
opening it , the software said 
create desktop short cuts so people do n't have 
update it 
software told 
Wacom , or my MacBook Pro?Yeah , this piece of trash is going back

It says

tablet itself seems okay 
followed all instructions 
came time to access free software bundle , the company 's website seemed to have stopped 
email messages 
which apparently I do 
try to reregister , I get an invalid code number message 
n't return it to Amazon because I discovered 
use Wacom products again 
never had a bad experience 
something happens 
purchased the tablet 
replace the cable because my unit was still under warranty 
try different cables until I find 
tech said to go 
that fits 
had an older Wacom Bamboo medium tablet 
tablet will solve my lack 
old tablet write 
made a big mistake 
get one thing out of the way first 
tablet has the exact same resolution 
buying this tablet 
This means 
that have made 
Bamboo from 2009 still works 
want anything more accurate than 2500 lines per inch , you must get a professional level Intuos 
what I had before 
size of the pen makes it very difficult to hold 
makes a very difficult 
having a nice counterweight 
removed the eraser 
when I took notes 
shrink the size of the tablet while maintaining 
Wacom have decided to remove 
writing on the edges of the active area , I can still use the edge of the tablet to rest 
writing experience 
hit a cliff 
when I write on the edge the tablet 
comfortably rest your hands on if you 're working 
all of the quick access button was placed 
This made it extremely easy to access all my shortcuts 
express keys because you will never use 
buy a used professional line Wacom tablet 
have much better resolution 
used Wacom tablet will still work 
buy a last generation 
Which begs the question , why would you buy 
using Wacom products 
first tablet lasted ten years 
then had a lot 
second gave me a few years 
that was giving me grief 
instructions included to install 
it does n't do 
what it 's supposed to 
it thinks 
probably since our call was nearing their clock-out time 
rep , while I was waiting for the driver to load , rushed 
what to do 
Well , it 's still not working 
thing working properly 
evening trying to get 
find a more sustainable option 
only use stylus 
it is designed 
Buyers should install the software immediately 
bought this 
key is used 
emailed support 
someone stole the software key 
then sold the product 
why the software key does n't work 
calibrate the pad to use 
bought this 
using '' it now 
have about 20-30 hours 
Let me be clear , this product works as advertised 
these make your projects 
so using a mouse 
turning on `` smooth stroke 
have the choice 
what paint strength 
pad gives me pressure 
So , once again , this review is more focused 
using a mouse 
ask amazon 
buttons get stuck 
wireless module starts glitching 
Pen did not work 
still can not use it properly 
daughter received it two days ago 
save her work 
tablet itself seems to be good quality 
download the paint program 
contacted the company twice now 
noticed quite a few people 
It seemed 
it does n't 
stylus would register , even when I reinstalled 
controllable widths could be achieved for strokes / vector based pressure sensitive lines 
get your effect 
build it 
assuming your style 
this is not going compare 
why digital art looks the way 
gave me a new understanding 
it does 
using this 
it seemed 
buttons on the stylus were n't quite optimally placed 
made the stylus as sensitive 
nib also wore down quicker 
overwhelming amount and texture of the plastic felt a bit cheap 
it seems perfectly sturdy 
also tested the Apple Pencil 
which has no looseness 
tablet feels like it has n't been upgraded 
test as many 
long review helped someone 
wanted a simpler version 
owned multiple Intuos Pro tablets 
contacted Wacom support 
When provided the different tech specs 
opening the package I noticed one major issue 
using the pen for a few days and declaring it a nightmare to use , I purchased the standard grip pen 
declaring it a nightmare 
standard pen that came with the tablet will work 
that came 
used Wacom tablets in the past this issue will drive you bananas 
yr old , who is very computer savvy as am I , first could n't get the tablet registered-took 
that came 
it 's still not working 
received it 
it is declined 
daughter enters the serial number 
designed this one 
designed websites 
have zero customer service 
mean ZERO 
friend of mine who is a graphic artist recommended this tablet 
it appears 
returning it 
Amazon not support a company 
what I needed 
far I hate it 
So , I purchased the tablet to create 
that I give 
countless files of art design software downloaded 
that will meet my extremely simple needs perfectly 
purchased this because it comes 
However , the set up disk does not offer the software 
first register your product 
then the free software is provided 
links do not work 
conveniently that aspect of the website is also not functioning properly 
people who are artists and graphic designers have some amazing software 
use this tablet to create 
who does n't have software 
enjoy your wait 
who was looking forward 
tablet seems to be ok 
had a terrible experience 
bought this as a gift for my daughter over 3 weeks ago 
received a welcome email 
However , when trying to log in soon after , they had a sign 
not log in or download the software 
site would be undergoing maintenance 
apply the Wacom registration key 
This does n't work 
filed a case 
got an invalid login error 
clicked that 
not received any reset email 
notices seem to have come down , though the site is buggy 
called support again 
reset my password 
Eventually the nice agent said 
n't expect a call 
not get an offer 
download the software 
daughter has been making tons 
reinstall the Wacom version 
which she has 
which are going to be lost 
qualify this 
Once my case is solved 
easily spent $ 99 of my time dealing 
button will not consistently work 
pen left 
had a Wacom Bamboo tablet 
it works better 
not even use it 
not return it 
wasted my $ $ 
Now I can do nothing 
ordered this one 
ordering it 
functions do n't work 
that does n't work 
Registration asks 
needed a tablet 
that I had did not upgrade their drivers 
tablet does work 
style of drawing requires you just to use 
it performs beautifully 
have a larger Wacom 
what you need 
decide that a tablet is what you need and if you are wanting to get started in digital art ... Wacom works 
please do n't buy this one 
Save your money 
buy the larger Intros 
n't register the product 
this shipped quickly 
Ca n't download the free software 
have some fun 
download is missing 
it says nothing 
it says 
it comes 
want my full return 
that I paid 
Worked perfectly just took awhile to get 
hurt my wrist to use 
every used any other Wacom 
highlighting text 
trying to design with the pen , your hand will mistakenly hit the surface 
causing it to go 
It ca n't tell if you want 
palm is making the selection 
only using the pen tool 
Save some money 
n't get the touch 
n't have this technology fine 
wacom refused to replace 
pen was broken 
device works great 
software does not exactly work 
products go up 
living doing design work 
using a tablet 8-10 hrs 
felt like serious working tools , this thing feels 
making unicorn doodles 
whatever else this device might have going 
it might work if you have 
It feels like you 're holding 
Previous pens had more of a profile and a small dip in front of the buttons so it was quite easy 
See my close 
it provides no grip 
surface of the pen has a very , very , VERY subtle texture 
pen wants to slide 
that worked far better 
Previous pen versions had a grippy rubber material 
see photo 
It just looks 
Well that 's got 
constantly triggering accidental actions 
how to position my hand to prevent 
Maybe once I 've used it 
more I 'll figure out the subtle nuance 
which does n't make them particularly useful as modifiers since you have 
programmable buttons placed 2 
have uses for these buttons other 
that is intended to store 
requires the strength 
Wacom nailed 
which helps when stowing 
WACOM has slipped yet again 
buy this cheap-o toy , hang on to the packaging , because you may 
it set 
cried about 6 times while setting 
mine came in was rather battered 
tape had been broken 
so it was opened before 
packaging was even scratched inside 
Also did n't get the extra pen nibs 
it 's supposed to come 
get the same tablet again but 
lost her pen 
probably give it 5 stars 
really likes this product 
hate it since the pen sold 
bought this item 
loved it 
It worked great 
It zooms 
where she did n't draw anything 
It leaves pen marks 
creating beautiful artwork until it went 
getting hold

having any problems whatsoever with your expensive product , Wacom will not be there to assist 
issue , could n't calibrate 
had the Wacom pen

It feels cheap , like cheap light wight plastic 
just saving my money 
needed a new tablet because the USB port on my Intuos4 Medium broke 
considering my other pens 
which I am using the grab 
edge gets stuck?My opinion 
weak it caves in 
slightly when I press the button 
it 's 
sometimes send the tablet 
what happens 
buttons and touch commands provide no response 
Then sometimes it seems 
bought the wireless kit 
it was working perfectly 
wirelessly because the usb port is broken 
setting up buttons 
setting the top buttons 
Center '' is confusing 
product should NOT carry the Intuos name 
charge my Intuos 's battery 
n't pay more than $ 50 for this product though 
spend money on future Waccom devices such as a new Cintiq when the Intuos line has degraded 
returning this because it was just a disappointment 
First off when I opened it 
have several issues 
it would n't allow me to register 
It just did n't work 
i have ever bought 
it does n't come

keys moved when using 
it would not move properly even when I got 
It was taking me forever to move 
use two monitors 
it would not move well 
product would interfere greatly 
that 's without using 
tried 2 different sources 
give it 3 starts 
what were you thinking 
why i was replacing my current keyboard 
actually give it 4 starts 
lacks the quietness 
stated the space-bar seems standard 
rest of the keyboard has 
having the function key next to the shift key making 
even removed the function key 
cant comment much on the mouse because I have 
it seems too light too small and feels cheap 
Changing my review 
folks like myself often ignore the 1 star reviews 
offered free products 
regarding my negative review 
received an email 
not change my review of this product based on the offer 
build quality 
It does n't scroll 
mouse also has a delayed response 
LED backlight stopped working 
mouse itself works great 
Blue led 
It should NOT be advertised 
do unpredictable things 
Moving it faster 
has very short cord 
received this mouse , it worked very well 
mouse would randomly stop working 
it became very frustrating 
working can be maddening 
Maybe I just received a faulty one 
Never had such a P. O. S 
find another 
NOT buy this one 
it basically did n't work 
gave it 
bought a much less expensive mouse 
what you pay for 
it felt good , nice grip 
losing the shot 
it will randomly act as if I unclicked 
When playing certain games 
that involve holding 
it does this 
So in all , do n't expect this to blow 
had this mouse for about 5-6 months now 
use it mostly 
ago , the scroll wheel started `` skipping 
scroll 2-clicks 
nothing happens 
how it compares 
had mice 3-4 times the cost 
It spins 
Lose the connection 
It never worked 
that I received 
n't even deserve a single star 
what setting 
Adjusting was easy 
respond , it scrolled sporadically 
wheel almost immediately broke , leaving 
It drains battery life super 
new batteries were emptied within an hour or two , even with the lights 
tracking was also broken 
massive earthquake happening 
it would start sporadically bouncing 
n't even have my hand 
in and it already stopped working 
left clicker got stuck 
buttons doesnt 
how it look 
then the scroll button would skip up whenever I would try 
mouse started acting 
dragging the mouse pointer across the screen , the pointer would frequently freeze even though the mouse was still moving 
son bought the mouse for use in online gaming where quick action is required in order to `` survive '' , so a freezing-up mouse was unacceptable 
where quick action is required in order to `` survive 
order a different mouse 
It was returned 
plan on using this for a laptop , just throw it away once you get 
work laptop just to test 
used this 
It ALWAYS freezes for a half-second when your using 
Consider this your lazy sibling 
who refuses to go 
it worked fully as intended I would have loved 
mouse itself has some nice features such as the click being very `` soft '' and not clicky like most mice are , as well as the ability 
shut off the battery 
that emanates 
click being very `` soft 
However in my experience this mouse has a fatal flaw 
mouse seems to have 
that in theory would extend the life 
move it around until it finally reconnects 
auto turn off feature 
cursor will move 
mouse will seemingly lag 
it seems only when it feels 
problem is usually solved by turning 
that hopefully lives up to my expectations as to what constitutes 
Amazon has a great return policy 
returning this mouse 
all experienced the same issues 
using Windows 
returned the product 
what I expected after reading 
deginer should have considered writing 
went back the

considering the price 
only given it one star 
Plastic feels pretty cheap 
really enjoyed this mouse when I first got 
it 's made this mouse practically useless 
ever since my scroll wheel bugged 
never did anything 
that would 've caused it 
took great care 
giving it 2/5 currently , because it was a good mouse 
broken , it 's made this product worthless 
got a solid 5 months of use out of it before it malfunctioned 
worst mouse i have ever purchased 
click doesnt even register 
it barely clicks 
it lags basically every 10 seconds 
wasting $ 14 
had adjustable DPI 
that fit comfortably 
originally purchased this mouse because I do 
wanted a mouse 
that means nothing to me because it does n't work 
mouse does fit pretty nicely 
Save yourself $ 14

bought a gaming mouse 
way , not a fan of this mouse and would n't recommend this one 
got two mice 
both of them did n't work 
censer broke 
Good design for gaming but the mouse loses connection to wireless receiver constantly 
It hesitates 
useless for any application let alone gaming 
$ 5 mouse from the grocery store works better 
it still randomly loses signal 
It says 
not recommend this 
It somehow slows down my computer

looking mouse if it was n't broken

Left-Click does n't work unless you jam 
Where as the Right-Click works perfectly fine 
wheel is no longer working

mouse arrived 
it did n't appear to be new 
Confirmed this suspicion when I opened

not give it a star if I had 
paid $ 13.95 
just have bought more

that would not work properly 
mouse may have the flashy looks 
it has a fatal flaw

It does not respond well to small scrolls , making 
little , just a few pixels for small scrolls , then accelerates way

keys worked on 
just do n't have time 
wanted a keyboard with all of the keys right next 
replacing the batteries weekly and while typing , some keys are not being picked up even though I am 2 feet 
That 's 
what I get 
certain keys just wo n't work 
LOVE Anker , so this review has 
cost of packaging & returning it for me would exceed the amount 
Unfortunately for me , I 've already thrown the box away 
returning it 
keyboard keeps missing 
people complain 
Soon as I put batteries 
indicator went red meaning 
needed new batteries 
which I just installed 
key lags 
it take forever 
Almost as if it needs to `` warm 
IDK , maybe i got a defective model 
product would have lasted quite a bit longer 
get it to reestablish 
sending me a replacement 
Ihave bought other Anker products 
had problems 
that Anker provides 
sent me a replacement 
enough about the company service that Anker provides they are my go 
charging cables 
hit the wrong key 
take a magnified look 
again , if you do n't hit the right key dead center , your finger will automatically tend to slide 
mouse stopped working 
returning it 
n't need the extra mouse 
sell just the keyboard 
Mouse works pretty well 
often than not , keys will trigger twice when pressed 
that will drive people 
It 's as if someone on the design team had suggested 
's make a keyboard 
that works 
has glitches 
who use it insane 
mission accomplished 
Mission accomplished my friends 
it came 
ordered this item 
set everything up sand while everything is 
it is not angled like I prefer 
folded the legs back down 
noticed on the one leg the middle stops 
ot put the legs back up 
it goes lower 
However the other legs does not stop where it should 
one that works properly fits snugly 
that works properly 
swapped the one leg 
leg that is not working still does not stop

experienced the sticky key 
three developed some kind 
owned three 
one of them had the double keystroke 
first keyboard had 
left CTRL button go bad 
workflow suffered until Anker replaced 
bought a second set after that for keeping 
developing a `` ghost '' key problem 
which change the way 
activates sticky keys 
This sometimes manifests 
That is infuriating to me because I do n't always know 
how to turn the sticky function 
keyboard would intermittently release the key even though I was physically holding it down , causing 
strange issues with keys and connectivity persisted 
problems I listed above have gotten too frustrating 
keyboard and mouse feel 
genuinely hope that 
review helps someone 
Routinely loses connection even as close 
subpar components used in this keyboard and mouse combo all culminate 
Keyboard stopped working 
Mouse worked great 
where it automatically puts my windows 
some of the keys stop working 
keyboard has a weird problem 
where it would start double clicking 
mouse began developing problems where it would start double clicking on a single right click 
however , it had the same issue when connected 
reading online for some help -LRB- since Anker would n't help me after 1st year of purchase -RRB- It was very disappointing 
Anker would n't help 
learned my lesson there 
keyboard died slowly 
receiving the combo 
performance was degrading rapidly 
keyboard was missing key input 
quickly shipped a replacement 
emailed Anker 
MISSED MY RETURN WINDOW 
then used the replacement unit 
Now , even the replacement unit is failing 
Control and Windows key sometimes lock in , or wont depress at all , making 
wont depress 
wouldnt wish 
keyboard has gone 
Keys randomly not working 
service seems to be pretty good 
believed some 
keyboard just does n't cut it 
use it for awhile , it misses the first keystroke 
This happens multiple times 
worse , I randomly receive an extra letter 
Returning this pile 
putting it to market 
Did Anker NOT test 
love the feel of the keyboard - it seems 
sticky key short cut randomly gets activated 
keys randomly do n't work 
n't get it to turn 
actually getting a new one 
need a truly quiet keyboard to use 
thing picks 
mic is also gated 
cigarette falling 
it picks up the typing 
how this can be considered `` whisper quiet 
keyboard still did n't work 
that worked 
FYI , I 'm running an HP Paviion 27xi 
that makes a difference 
brand kept locking 
2nd `` replacement '' keyboard lasted 
keyboard just does n't do the job 
mouse seems to work 
it started spazzing 
performing some kind 
company finally sent me a replacement

one may have lasted 
It wo n't operate 
that have nothing 
monitor starts flashing 
windows are popping 
hit a letter key 
period of time to return has already expired 
NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY 
n't had any problems 
purchased the Anker CB 310 Wireless 
condition of the 18-month warranty be to extend 
keys require a heavy touch 
CB 310 lacks smoothness , to mean 
speed & accuracy has diminished since using 
learned proper typing skills 
that I 've used working 
performing typing & data entry 
purchased the Anker CB 
made a quick decision because suddenly the keyboard I had been using would NOT work 
technician explained 
recommended the Anker CB 
need a good quality , durable 
it locked 
Keyboard looked great 
Multiple reboots did not cure 
mouse stopped 
working and keyboard continues to work 
Batteries changed 
It drops reception constantly 
buying this 
Others have experience 
using it 
it keeps disconnecting 
use my computer 
keyboard constantly misses keys , loses 
cause the whole thing to glitch 
Tab and `` Windows '' key get stuck 
Buy a Logitech keyboard 
save yourself the problems 
bought this product because I was eager 
tried the Anker USB hub 
it worked just fine 
try the keyboard 
worked fine 
what I 've done to resolve 
tested it 
sending a dongle to try 
much time resolve a fairly urgent issue 
just bought another Logitech to be delivered 
weeks in it sporadically skipped so we thought 
it completely deleted a tremendous amount 
that was typed 
it was lost 
mean , it reversed everything 
not recommend this product 
n't buy the Anker brand again 
liked the keyboard BUT 
first key pressed 
Unfortunately , the replacement has THE SAME PROBLEM 
first key pressed again 
wellUpdate !!!! Mouse stopped working

that I am disappointed

it again to keep moving 
character would randomly stop walking 
It started happening every couple of seconds , making 
touching the keyboard 
Then the keyboard randomly started sending false signals like pressing the B key without me touching the keyboard , resulting 
quickly sent me a free replacement 
contacted Anker 
service does n't get any better 
replacement would work properly because the aesthetic design of this keyboard and mouse is very good 
using the new keyboard 
same problem started to occur 
have no choice 
found an alternative wireless keyboard 
keyboard was not working 
Out of the box had 
Anker improve the quality 
It was made 
n't recommend this

ABSOLUTE JUNK ... DO NOT BUY ... Eats batteries 
'M SLOW 
used it , the louder the keys got 
n't leave a ZERO 
that my microphone would n't pick 
bought this thinking 
it would work 
Placing the keyboard next to my mike , the sounds get picked up quite well so my mike is great 
However , by placing this keyboard under the table and on my lap , my mike did n't pick 
it comes 
IS LOUD

Desktop 800 for BusinessWhen the letters had nearly all rubbed off my last Microsoft keyboard 
thinking quieter keys 
take ' something 
keys will randomly either stick 
typing is filled 
which it never was before when using other keyboards 
This makes my day to day work miserable 
so I have stuck it out a few months to see 
it might be related to how I typed 
it has only gotten worse 
finally ordered another Microsoft set to replace 
received an email from Anker stating 
Shortly after posting this review

that had a mouse with thummb buttons , so that was kindd 
gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because here I am 
kind of crack head you have to be 
First of all the thumb buttons on the mouse are reversed

using some pretty cheap PTFE stickers 
it functions so it gets 
feet were scratched 
Received this product 
things on both keyboard and mouse has been breaking 
taken proper care 
this set 
read the past reviews 
it seems 
hopefully I just received a defective equipment 
scrolling on this mouse somehow broke 
It takes me about 3 full scrolls 
It does n't register most 
typer , DO NOT GET THIS KEYBOARD 
letters will get typed either 2 or 3 times 
it works the next it stops 
connecting so one min 
mouse has a hard time 
bought this product over eight months ago , yet I 'm only now writing 
it may help 
mention the price 
It makes 
getting an awesome deal 
gimmick works , because I fell 
bought this bundle , I immediately was having issues 
pressed the `` 3 '' key , it would sometimes come 
admittedly do n't quite remember the specifics 
This also occurred 
imagine , this made it extremely frustrating 
tried pretty much everything 
emailed support 
exchanged a few emails 
sent the keyboard and mouse combo back 
later I received new ones 
wrote a review 
new keyboard worked wonderfully 
mouse started acting 
that I 'm still dealing 
Sometimes when I click , it will register 
prematurely drop the thing 
which will unhighlight the text 
mouse will sometimes act as if I 've clicked 
move the mouse 
that I was dragging 
dropping things 
This makes doing 
requested help 
did everything 
that would eventually have major issues 
awesome the product could be if it actually worked 
suppose the thing 
that frustrates 
change the speed 
which have 
it does n't , I 'll be avoiding 
such , I 'm giving this product two stars 
It has some really wonderful things 
it has trouble 
doing even basic tasks 
review -LRB- it 's more of a story , really -RRB- has given you a better idea 
solidify your decision as to whether or not you 'll buy 
however everything else about this keyboard really left me a bit disappointed 
it seems to be rubberized 
keys themselves are all set 
which did not seem to do 
some of which I could not even discern 
have no space 
making this more 
keyboard does not support ANY level 
that supports any customization 
customize every single fkey 
which lets 
customization is extremely lacking 
combo has no problem 
it works fine 
simply assign `` Ctrl 
it looked like it filled 
it may be because I use 
epic failed 
recently spilled beer 
rinsed the keyboard 
It unjammed some keys 
still had problems 
took the keyboard apart 
dried it 
whole row of keys no longer works 
found remnants 
That 's it 
It seems to be broken 
Unfortunately I 've had the same experience 
connection started to cut out intermittently , so 
letters often get dropped while I 'm typing 
occasionally the keyboard will stop working 
basically `` re-boot '' it 
remove the battery 
also echo the note 
someone else provided 
just ca n't use the keyboard 
Good keyboard but the space bar squeaks 
It often stops 
keep the mouse 
taking a sledgehammer 
review has taken a good five minutes to write 
it maintain a steady connection 
wasted the money 
hear '' it 
every once in a while , it will just stop communicating 
It ends 
that needed a quick answer 
soon as I can find something that really is quiet and wireless , I 'll toss this thing 
that I recieved 
never purchase an Anker product again 
installing it 
powerful magnifier had diffifulty 
havve everr had-overs sensitive keys

when I saw the ad 
keyboard and mouse seem to quite often lose 
onscreen pointer disappears sometimes 
mouse goes unresponsive 
where on the computer the USB dongle is plugged 
This all happens no matter 
this does not fix anything 
used several sets 
that feel just right 
too as sometimes I need fast tracking 
Ca n't comment on the battery life yet as I just started 
it lasts 
Also it must be noted 
has an `` on/off '' switch , the keyboard seems to not have

lot of special one touch function keys already assigned 
save the battery

support seems to be lacking 
not find an Anker user forum as well 
Anker did contact

which expires unless you pay 
which does not allow you to change 
get a mouse options screen 
keys along the top of the keyboard require a fair amount 
keys have a nice quality touch

Thrwing it away 
it lags when gaming 
it would delay 
it playing Minecraft

how the keys feel 
experience was ruined 
running a game 
had high expectations 
that eventually went south 
this would prove better 
using the K350 
eventually the mouse and keyboard would take longer and longer siestas

never recommend this 
installed the gaming software 
Just received the mouse 
Everything works 
fixed the problem 
googled help 
it fixed or smash it 
leaving it 
owned many , many Logitech mice 
mouse I 've bought has eventually been clicking twice or three times 
once when I click the left mouse button 
It seems to happen 
model lasted 
defect , once it manifests , makes gaming impossible 
that break so predictably 
mice do n't use low-quality switches 
bought a G400s mouse new in Nov 2013 -LRB- less than 50 bucks then -RRB- when I rebuilt 
found my old MX518 
spend 1.5 
broken or miss-aligned the action 
click feels 
Went online 
mouse has button issues 
answer tickets randomly 
it appears 
Buy a different mouse 
worked but after 15 months of use , the right click button does n't work properly 
using the mouse 
button does n't return 
that may have broken 
still use it 
do any fast function 
Mouse worked fine 
This resulted 
wheel felt a little stiff 
which finally began to fail 
it feels quite similar 
Hopefully , it will last at least as long 
what I wrote a year ago 
Now , it 's intermittently failing , with the laser blinking off/on at random times because the cord is shorting 
It has never been mishandled 
never dropped it or yanked on the cord at all , just very normal use 
when Logitech made good quality products 
wheel set 
owned this model 
However , I have noticed the quality 
one has stopped working 
not be buying this mouse again 
that you own it 
mouse works great 
securing the cable so it will never catch 
cable is pulled 
It 's looking like I paid 
that ca n't be programmed 
button just below the scroll wheel will not program 
send it 
Right button started getting stuck at every click 
definitely return it if I could 
ergonomics suck 
purchased this to do 
it tends to cramp 
have HUGE hands 
shape or possibility could i use this 
nice the implementation failed 
left mouse button sometimes is stuck 
so i returned it 
i got 4 
that did n't match the box making 
that would scrape 
that would n't register 
that would scroll the opposite direction 
replaced it with seems 
regret the purchase 
Leaves your hand 
everything worked perfectly 
click its very clicky 
it feels really unnatural 
negative helpful review stated 
left click went rogue 
it really does not feel good 
makes a considerable difference 
cursor sometimes moves on its own , requiring 
This happened even after updating 
that sometimes switches direction for a moment when scrolling 
It worked all of 3 mo before the typical Logitech cord disconnect issues happened 
First the scroll wheel stopped working 
's no way to change the functionality of the scroll wheel in the logitech software so I could n't reassign 
change the functionality 
Then yesterday it just stopped being able 
n't select anything 
still move the pointer around 
exploring software prefs 
software installs 
change any settings 
Seriously , how can they release software 
Supposedly , you can trick the software into working 
people stay away 
ago I bought a Razer Deathadder mouse 
poorly the Razer mouse performed 
ever having tried another mouse 
G400S works flawlessly 
that I would highly recommend 
Used a G5 for years , loved it 
wore it 
comprehend that , you 'll understand this 
see a plastic cable 
want a sturdy braided cable 
break the mouse 
yanking the cable 
it would come out easily 
change the coating 
which I really do recommend 
So of course I sent it 
WELL COVERED BRAIDED CABLE 
Tested all the buttons 
DPI down button would not work unless pressed 
buttons engage 
buttons work better on-the-fly 
Logitech needs to make 
n't feel much difference 
just got my new G400S 
took it 
returning this product 
try the G500 
mouse does not feel good 
This remote sucks cheap piece 
not buy this remote 
Spend a couple 
bucks more 
get the ourspop remote 
's no touchpad 
it takes AAA batteries 
Left click does n't work 1 
plugged it 
once i got this open 
lights did not work 
left click started 
using it the first day 
save your money 
get one 
it all went bad 
expect all 7 buttons to have 
buy a 7 button mouse 
need their very specific function 
One changes the DPI 
spent money 
so i wasted this buy 
It looks nice bit 
performance dropped 
's a lag when I click 
Many clicks do n't get registered 
play only CSGO 
n't pick this mouse 
reposition your hand 
using it for gaming it slips 
package came 
containing the mouse pad 
Disappointing as the package containing the mouse pad clearly says 
it contains the mouse 
pad came 
mouse did n't 
What should I do 
when the shipment arrived the only contents 
Returned it , the item shipped 
having it 
It stopped working 
got it and opened the box it came in , the car was missing a wheel 
it came in 
opened the box 
tried to use my 3wheeled car , it worked fine until my computer screen went 
moving the 3 wheeled car to wake the computer up , the computer would n't recognize the mouse 
So now my 3 wheeled 
car/mouse sits on the shelf to remind 
how to utilize batteries 
get what u pay 
never got the USB receiver 
n't use it 
It died 
got new batteries , put new ones 
put another set 
lasted an hour 
put another 
it would n't come on 
So , there 's my experience 
Hope it helps 
it came broken 
it looks cute 
USB for the mouse broke off in the port when it was being removed 
now the mouse does n't work 
n't recieve the u. s. receiver 
therefor I ca n't use the mouse 
it broke a few moments after I opened 
received it 
that cost twice the price 
mouse is working well , better 
browsing the web 
where I want it to go 
prefer the small removable base piece off the mouse as it allows 
solid feel and the buttons have a nice `` click 
reviews mention the quality 
rubber/plastics have 
mouse created an issue 
around/in the IT field 
SUCKS!I have been involved 
it created a situation 
that at first had 
thinking my PC 
BIOS failed 
rebooting was VERY slow 
having constant low memory issues 
loading a webpage using 
it must have a heat or hardware problem 
built this PC some time ago 
it runs pretty much 24/7 
Again in all the years I have never seen such a thing 
bad USB cable cause a PC to hang 
PC is running great as it always has again now 
what they have to say 
replace it 
how customer service handles this situation 
sent the seller an email 
it caused 
added the troubles 
edited my first review 
also issued a full refund 
seller gets a 10 
it created 
mouse still gets a 1 star 
Hopefully they will read it here

ITEM SMELLS SO BAD 
PLEASE avoid if you plan 
use a mousepad 
recommend a better one 
It does n't look hard 
threw it 
It smells 
n't use it because I will pass 
work of I am passed 
It works otherwise 
flimsy very light weight , moves 
Used it 
tossed it 
read some reviews before I bought 
n't buy it 
what you pay for 
it made the whole room smell like someone lit 
stench invades the area and demands to be known 
threw it 
that smell '' murmurs 
get my money back 
definitely learned my lesson to check 
things smell awful 
smell was making 
Now I have nothing 
just missed the window 
cover detaches 
pad smells really bad 
hand now stinks 
not recommend this product 
it still stinks 
Probably will just throw it 
Worst mouse pad I 've EVER owned -- does n't register the movements 
give money 
n't buy this unless you like 
like to give money away , please send some to me first 
give money 
it would n't slide 
around ... if it had a rubber bottom 
Prior to that , your hand would reek just from using 
had it in an even semi-enclosed room , the whole room would smell 
mousepad was basically dressed plastic 
it slides 
It does work 
it looks like it was manufactured 
it goes 
i ca n't stand even 
smell always prevails 
read reviews 
how it got 
noticed that 
pad smells hideous 
that should only exist 
Piuuuuu - they smell so toxic 
smell this mat 
it stinks 
trush it 
disgusting - goint to trush it now 
which has a much nicer material 
just bought another 
try to perpendicular , the grain affects your mouse greatly 
pointer moves only half the distance 
it would move 
get something a bit nicer 
skip this one 
n't normally leave bad reviews 
covering material started peeling of the foam portion of the pad on day two of using 
curled so much 
mouse slides 
slides around too much does n't stay 
cloth started falling 
that you offer 
smells is unbearable 
not buy this 
pad wo n't even work 
try it 
it will go 
n't follow movement up 
It would cost me more to return 
had good quality rubber backing 
poorly made foam type material 
Gray & Red have no rubber backing 
it came in 
it happened 
package it came in did not look damaged 
purchased this 
June 29 and the sides of the top cloth are already peeling away 
It 's looking pretty bad next 
mousepad itself slips a crap ton 
which should n't even happen 
It has a plastic top 
it grounded 
right product cause everyones pictures 
reviews looked different 
dont bother 
using a piece 
Good item , however it took 4 days for it to air 
got it 
it started to fall 
which has lasted 
It 's has a really strong smell 
sent me the wrong color 
top layer got 
n't buy it 
it does not work 
have a wireless optical mouse 
optical mouse works on this mouse pad before you buy 
please be sure 
that does n't let an optical mouse work 
never seen a mouse pad 
Wreaks of cigarette smoke , makes my whole desk smell 
thing smells SO BAD 
It works just fine 
n't buy it , seriously 
It felt gritty 
mouse did n't roll over it easily 
blue material started curling 
that does n't slide 
Smell went away 
Otherwise , works fine 
which lasted 
This smells 
leaves a really bad smell 
what you pay for 
it slides on top of your desk fairly easily 
thing feels cheap 
set something fragile 
keep the camera from scratching 
co-worker has a big photography camera and needed a pad to keep the camera from scratching the glass desk or vice-versa , so I gave 
this and it works perfect 
needed a pad 
so I removed it 
now my mouse does n't slide as easily 
fabric started peeling 
received the free pads 
top layer separated 
has awful rubber 
It does n't stay in place , so you constantly have 
it smells 
Finally figured out it is the mousepad 
Several others have complained 
Cadillac did when you were a kid 
Cheap mouse pad , will NOT stay flat turn 
blue cover started peeling 
smell will not go away 
thing stinks 
Literally I can smell it 
it goes away 
Fingers crossed 
Sadly this product is cheesily made 
surface is delaminating 
It lasted just about long enough to be beyond the date 
price seemed too good to be true 
it does n't stay slides around 
i use it 
off , it feels just like flimsy , thin plastic when compared 
hard work was NOT put 
plugged it in , it did n't even work 
tried the USB connector 
it did n't work 
ordered a new -LRB- hopefully working -RRB- gaming mouse 
already sent it back 
wheel DOES NOT HAVE LIGHTING 
roll came 
it works if u can get 
price should reflect this despite what the reviews says 
old stock feets on my Sensei Wireless glides 10 times better 
this is meant to be a high end feet 
Tape works fine , except there creases 
having tape 
Defeats the purpose of having tape , might as well have 
use a cloth mouse pad 
Whenever I apply the tape 
friction between my mouse pad and mouse feet cause the tape to come 
it feels so sticky when I move 
n't buy this 
bought this to try 
tape stuck well 
it did not fix the badly designed mouse 
lost or damaged mouse feet 
Also , when installed , it does not give any significant advantage 
mouse still feels hard to move 
still bought this one 
product has negative review 
bought this tape to try 
pulled some off to cover 
cleaned up the mess 
began gaming 
it felt like it was slower 
It actually felt like there was 
swapped that to test 
hard aluminum backed pad 
steelseries qck pad 
Nothing changed 
ripped off the tape 
tested the original mouse again to see 
perceiving the drag incorrectly 
original razer diamondback feet were exposed 
mouse started to glide 
once the tape was removed 
leaving no residue 
just bought a razer deathadder to replace 
currently using a Razer scarab mouse pad 
deathadder literately makes a grinding sound when moving 
quality has dropped 
trying this tape on my deathadder to see 
update my review once I give 
Put some 
It did help 
smooth out the deathadder a little bit 
used my kershaw to cut 
find the material 
original razer diamondback feet were made 
sum it up , it depends 
it ca n't compete 
mouse looks perfect 
Unfortunately reality does n't live 
that feels like its going 
it is made 
lot of play in the button builds 
n't respond well , lots 
it is just poorly designed 
It takes a lot 
why hey went 
metal does n't mean durable 
When moving the mouse around it rattles 
had high hopes 
happily pay much more 
mouse looks solid 
buttons are really inconveniently placed 
Mouse itself is working correctly 
it is still working 
Mine stopped working 
It started disconnecting 
it started doing 
now it is doing 
that costs 70 $ 
build quality 
had similar issue 
now the sensor seems to be malfunctioning 
Mouse worked well 
Large , fast sweeps do n't register 
nothing has worked 
cleaning the sensor/mouse pad 
tried software fixes 
n't use windows 
n't use mac 
map most 
action I want , some of the more advanced features remain unavailable 
limited access 
enter a custom keystroke 
It could not update the app 
had a limited list 
it would n't let 
had Linux software support -LRB- specifically Debian -RRB- I would change this 
One of best mouse I have ever used , feels great 
what I do the Logitech Gaming Software 
which means 
not change DPI settings 
mouse has an unsigned driver 
Windows says 
doing research , a lot of people are having the same problem 
seen it 
somebody probably broke it 
only been using it 
Mine broke too 
months and i barely use the scroll 
own 10 + Logitech Products 
Razer may be the next click 
n't buy spectrum 
buy the non-rgb version 
have both RGB 
discussing all the buttons 
well it worked 
surfing the web 
trying this mouse out I gamed 
it served me well 
that stood 
It does n't have any rubberized coating or grippy surface to easily scroll 
Now , I could have turned on the free spin mode on the scroll wheel , but then it would go flying past the point where I would want to stop , necessitating 
then it would go flying 
that did not work 
contour of the mouse made it necessary to keep 
assume a more neutral position at 45 ° or even 30 ° while using 
This does n't sound that bad 
putting an undue strain 
using the mouse 
having physical symptoms 
using the mouse 
never had any issues 
design of the G5 never felt awkward 
n't cause me any pain 
using it 
however , the design did not work 
it should have more 
which is not as the product was advertised 
newest Logitech corded model mouse 
wanted up and down scroll 
Also , the middle mouse button no longer has the option 
bought a G500S 
want a working mouse 
it has a color display 
Logitech stopped manufacturing 
guessed it 
n't need another social networking link 
it working 
stops working and i have to unplug 
n't get a mouse yet 
buttons do not work 
wasted so much time 
basic mouses come 
It does n't look 
liked the sensor 
middle mouse click as my push to talk 
However , I encountered a problem 
middle mouse wheel supports three different clicks 
entering a dead zone 
wheel pushed 
scroll clicks equal 
Altering the mouse settings to set 
has no effect , because the space between them is truly a dead zone 
never encountered this problem 
reassign any 
tried this configuration 
Both have the same issue , so I 'm pretty sure 
wheel really does not work 
finger slipping 
i returned it and picked up a G500s instead 
picked up a G500s 
movement does n't 
buttons still work 
never had a single mouse break 
literally can not move the mouse without clicking 
n't even use this when 
Maybe I have big hands 
button depresses any time 
move the mouse 
not see the hype 
it looks okay 
wheel is made 
avoiding both this seller 
owned a 
laser started crapping 
never notice a problem 
many people mentioned 
where the thumb would rest 
Granted its a cool idea , to be able 
this was exactly where I wanted to rest 
which was being obstructed 
leave my thumb 
find a comfortable spot 
Also they changed the concave 
causing my crappy joints to pop 
extending my thumb the opposite direction 
never had a problem 
So I regretfully returned this 
both of which arent the same 
Beware the DPI shift button 
that has nothing 
n't abuse my hardware so I do n't know 
what 's happening 
It works - check 
rattle ?! 
Somebody has left this 
truly expected a quiet , well engineered product 
still keep a good grip 
still maintain accuracy 
use all buttons 
which makes it extremely hard to be precise 
it feels so sensitive when using 
returning these 
probably get something 
had a similar mouse 
one has a bottom 
that just falls off constantly while playing 
just poorly made , such an awful mouse 
that comes 
which I immediately rebind 
G700 has a much better design 
wheel make this mouse nearly useless 
mouse die on me so fast 
Save the box if you purchase 
cheep build 
It feels really flimsy 
spin , it has a tendency to roll back/forward in the opposite direction of the scroll once released , making 
it happened nearly every time 
used the free scroll 
replacing a G500 
that has become so common 
that come 
adjusting the weights 
how the mouse fits my hands 
gives it a great feel 
bought mice for $ 10 before that felt 
wheel is connected 
it having issues 
just have a feeling 
sending this one back 
i got a new one 
i 'll get 
just recently built a new high end PC for gaming primarily 
still use my MX518 
That being said 
utilize this mouse 
mentioned earlier , I still use my MX518 
switch lights 
edit basic functionality 
switch colors 
dpi hold 
i 'll accidentally tap the dip 
this may accidentally happen 
's the thing , it has a ` infinite scroll 
it 'll roll the opposite direction when you stop 
infinite scroll enabled 
tore apart this mouse 
that does n't seem to have 
have the infinite scroll disabled , you get a very tactile click 
It functions yes 
it actually moves left 
wheel click 
that makes 
wheel not sit 
wheel bounces left 
This means 
it rattling 
Youtube this to hear 
what i 'm talking 
started an RMA 
So here 's the deal 
Amazon would n't do an exchange 
purchased this mouse 
which i 'm having trouble confirming 
days sometimes an entire week go by before I get 
here 's the thing 
It also had this issue 
this is n't intended behavior 
Logitech claims 
that have also posted 
users do n't seem to have 
what happens 
this really bites as I want 
sing the highest 
Once this RMA goes through , if my new Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum does n't have 
update this review 
had an issue where the scroll wheel would sometimes not register 
Amazon had a bad batch 
liked all other aspects 
It 's working fine 
problems now like when I move my cursor 
mouse is having 
usually play csgo 
n't work fine 
wheel is misplaced 
have free-wheel or stepped scroll 
it almost always scrolls a line 
take your finger 
have dry fingers 
mouse I 've seen or used in the past 25 years is made 
how you can ship a product 
Returned it 
Stopped working right after return deadline closed 
mouse will not work 
It must be connected directly 
Logitech will not issue a refund or exchange if you did n't buy 
not get the software 
It keeps thinking 
had no solution 
called the company twice and 
running windows 
had no problems so it must be Logitech 
tried two other products 
constantly hitting the side button 
it does n't feel very comfortable 
Also the mouse feels flimsier 
Received twice , both units had something wrong 
bought the mouse on very high recommendations from numerous reviews only to be seriously disappointed 
mouse was working just fine 
movement randomly goes dead 
mouse randomly registers non existent left clicks

Purchased three 
Returned three 
Non worked properly 
just got it 
it does not work 
wheel broke 
Used for almost a month then it stated malfunctioning 
Mouse does not work 
that makes the mouse work 
usb portion that makes the mouse work was missing 
return it 
works ok though 
Missing the sub port to go 
It could work great 
used this mouse 
mouse rolls the cursor 
bought this cheap mouse while travelling 
what you pay 
it did n't turn 
It did n't work 
just wasted my money 
returning this 
It really looks cheap 
withstand a bit 
it feels like it wo 
kid would pay attention 
it stops working 
lights shut off every 5 minutes 
deserve a refund 
it is completely broken 
had the mouse 
which most 5 button mice have 
it works 
That means 
OS supports only 5 buttons without specific drivers , so if you see 
that does n't need a driver installation 
it has 
So you will find many models similar to this one , claiming 
mouse lasted 
it started disconnecting 
It got 
this was a steal 
Looked like all those name brands were charging premium 
That 's until the USB male plug stopped 
Windows 10 is telling 
device is not connecting properly 
What happened 
have no idea 
It 's plugged in like I always do 
sometimes the mouse works 
rarely play games 
working , it does its job well 
does that equal 
month rental fee?You decide 
it was triple-clicking 
left-click was double-clicking when I clicked 
that bind actions 
wheel never worked well 
doing two actions 
it randomly jumps up 
currently ca n't do anything 
that involves 
go and drop the item 
want to click & drag an item to move it , it will randomly let 
it will do a plethora 
select it 
opening stuff 
finalizing something 
want to single-click something to select it , the mouse may instead double-click 
it will let 
window around becomes a very troublesome task as it will not only let 
randomly maximize and resize the windows 
it looks like it was built 
timings work 
why it 's falsely advertised 
that is advertised 
get my money back , because this is probably the worst mouse 
that I used for 6 YEARS while doing 
mouse I used before this was a $ 5 gaming mouse that I used for 6 YEARS while doing very click-intensive tasks , being used very extensively 
's a lot of mice on here that look very similar to this one design-wise , and I 'd also advise avoiding those at all costs , because they 're very likely 
mouse shuts 
ONLY operates when the wire is positioned 
Everything functions as it should 
this in no way makes up for how often the mouse switches 
Failed after 3 1/2 months , wire at connection to mouse broke internally 
took about two months break in time for them to not do 
which is annoying if I 'm trying 
buttons would sometimes send the other thumb button signal 
This has a double-click button 
which is so far left 
n't bind it 
why anyone would use it 
button for mouse sensitivity did n't seem useful , besides 
then change my comps mouse accelerator settings 
what do I want 
plug it 
screen go black 
it stopped working 
this did not work 
figured this 
dpi determines the color of the mouse so once 
dpi was set 
knew exactly what rate 
reviewed this shortly after i bought 
Update : I reviewed this shortly after i bought it , however i must change my rating 
mouse worked great 
who play many hours 
wheel does n't work 
it operates as if i scrolled 
use the scroll 
that does n't actually function the way 
button 4 and 5 do n't even work anymore so 
it is supposed 
previous IXCC mouse stopped functioning 
i ordered a replacement 
replacement showed 
Not purchasing another one 
Now it wont turn 
when i plug it 
it still did n't work 
just got it 
it does n't work 
it looks really nice 
even plugged it 
contacted customer service 
had my mouse 
it was working really well 
Then , it stopped working 
it turned back 
Now , it has completely stopped working 
what you pay for I suppose 
it has a an extra button 
loved it 
UPDATE * Purchased this mouse 
it was working fine 
It had good response 
it now does not even connect 
Unfortunately the quality seems to be the downfall 
sent me a new one because it is under the 2 year guarantee 
mouse stopped working 
product does not seem to last 
suggestion would be to keep 
using it 
Was a good mouse 
just say its a disposable mouse 
it quit 
threw it 
pulled it 
Put in a 10 year old Dell mouse 
it needs a USB hub 
which makes it more distracting 
that does n't even add 
tested it 
product I received `` was not recognized 
got the mouse , it did n't work 
giving this two stars 
Tried it 
Even had my computer scientist husband look 
It fits a bit awkward 
It also has the recently popular ` matte ' finish 
that seems to drain 
when it first starts to move 
mouse sits on create 
replaced the ` skids 
Retuned , it would n't fit 
that is a computer programmer try 
even had my brother 
set it 
that has 
soundbot plugged 
saw the product on Amazon it shows photos 
gives you the impression 
simply plug soundbot 
either download a file 
When I receive the item 
need a computer 
that comes 
taking some time to download 
re-starting your laptop 
keep disc 
It may seem very simple 
include the little details 
n't leave steps 
It leaves certain things 
remove it before shutting 
It has become a waste 
test my limited comprehension 
how about creating a YouTube video 
what needs to be done because instruction booklet is lacking 
what is needed 
when making future products 
that shows step-by-step 
n't have the time 
ultimately could not get it 
contacted customer service 
threw it 
follow instructions online 
did attempt 
possibly give me a virus 
this did was cause other sound issues 
download drivers 
It does not work 
it quit broadcasting 
most do not honor their craftsmanship either 
WHEN IT IS USED 
GET STATIC 
had a horrible time 
hate throwing 
what I did 
have a desktop 
n't use it 
So I ca n't program my unit to sense 
what you pay for 
it is not plug and play as it states 
find the drivers 
It will not stay connected 
It works 
it has issues 
It comes 
using it 
install it and are using it , it has about 5 different services 
It does connect to bluetooth 
audio is lagged 
done the steps of disabling power management so that it is always on 
tried different settings 
set it 
allow application to take 
device can work 
where by itself it does not 
doing this , it seems to correctly load 
Even doing the simple test 
has audio lag 
audio bar go up 
tested the device thoroughly 
port extended , not a USB hub , making 
it uses 
have an older USB bluetooth dongle so I 'll just have 
one and its driver/software does not have any 
It does n't connect any 
It shows only the mac address 
n't get it 
n't get it to connect 
It would n't send any data , even after restarting

Installer hangs while installing 
then the uninstaller failed 
Install failed the first time 
Excel had to be shut 
computer take 23 mins to shut 
it still does n't connect with my bluetooth headphones while flashing 
probably would n't use it 
Even if it worked 
Get an adapter 
it takes 
working , the size of the driver install 
amount of time it takes makes me suspicious 
Device arrived not working 
PC will not recognize device 
video stated 
adapter should light up blue 
Mine did not 
Returning device 
sell another model 
thing still regularly spontaneously stops working 
Ca n't even be refunded

purchased this to plug 
device had trouble 
it overheated my comp , causing 
experienced the same issues 
purchased a new pc , in thinking 
using my NEW pc 
problem went away after unplugging 
5/5 would not recommend 
It did n't work 
spend time 
it still wo n't work 
ordered the wrong item so I do n't have 
product worked hardly 
guy could not get it to work 
i have to reset 
i connect it 
It destroys my headphones when 
It also can not support hd audio 
it does not have great connection 
originally purchased this adapter to add 
bought it along with the SoundBot SB240 bluetooth headset to ensure 
USB Adapter further compounded 
headset had shortcomings 
device initially installs easily enough 
lose all functionality the moment 
computer was powered back on 
adapter would completely disable 
adapter was plugged in and would not allow it to be re-enabled without an outright reboot , even when I click 
not allow it to be re-enabled 
It simply would not remember 
then re-enabling it 
manually disable the bluetooth radio myself before putting 
that would not guarantee it to work 
as , sometimes , the adapter would * still * stubbornly refuse to re-activate 
adapter would help 
defeated any purpose 
it may have served 
rebooting the computer in order to get 
favoring my old physically wired devices 
It left 
bought it 
eventually ordered the Kinivo Btd-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter 
what you pay 
It always works 
have Soundbot wireless headphones 
say the same 
it worked 
having Bluetooth headphones 
which totally defeats the purpose 
emailed Soundbot 
explaining the issue 
getting my bluetooth keyboard to connect 
does , it does n't function 
Then to remove something 
put it back 
not recommend this 
dongle fell apart after about two weeks if use 
It picked up a local keyboard somehow 
not the earbuds sitting next 
getting a refund 
others have had the same issue 
Sadly , it appears 
running windows 
purchased this to use 
once it came time 
process went smoothly 
Nothing happened 
it does n't work 
Buy something 
better The driver is messing up the sound 
entire casing came off when I was unplugging 
It worked 
it shut my Vista computer down twice 
Consumes a lot of system resources , even when it is in not connected 
it working 
had it 
which altered the sound 
thing drops the bluetooth connection 
thing started working 
it disconnects 
still can get this to reconnect 
restart the laptop 
hate it 
driver 's that come on the disk do n't work well 
that come 
which ended up working 
two and only one worked 
Buggy , could n't get 
Terrible sound quality , and stereo does n't actually come 
hook up to this sounds great hooked 
10I wasted 2 hours 
bluetooth is not seen 
Other specific application bluetooth adaters have worked fine 
i try it 
i tried it 
This did n't work 
it did not 
It is supposed to work 
Sometimes the sound will be very scrambled , like I was trying 
personally would just spend a little more 
get something better 
Caused my computer to run very slow , my computer was skipping 9/10 frames while this was inserted 
software was n't detecting the hardware 
restarting and my monitor started blinking furiously 
processor was defecting 
Luckily I took out the bluetooth usb 
everything returned 
get a replacement 
It is connecting 
n't waist your money 
conexión failed 
then is missing files 
Software takes a long time 
used it to make 
However people could not hear me clearly enough 
it eventually broke my connectivity 
had a few issues 
connecting with QCY headset the real problem 
when patches were applied 
it has something 
i think 
hash creation 
Uninstalling the Soundbot driver 
fixed both problems 
Wasted two hours 
First of all the software took about 25 minutes 
file was missing and install again 
Then I removed the software 
That took about an hour 
SB340 did connect 
not get sound 
how to activate A2DP 
Maybe software installation was required 
Maybe I will try a receiver 
that plugs 
install an 
So has Windows 
getting this to work 
have no trouble 
it is poorly written drivers 
it worked exactly as instructed 
Got a Kinivo 
which makes this product useless 
Drivers for this SB340 Bluetooth dongle do not work properly 
who will end up having 
include the lack 
vendor needs to update 
listing does n't include Windows 
hardware that worked under 7/8/8 .1 should also work under 10 unless the hardware expressly states 
that worked 
which just worked 
purchased two 
adapters also protruded less 
So I would advise anyone 
buying more 
install software 
download the software 
using this for could n't use 
adapter still did n't work 
wasting quite a bit of time , I finally found the information 
That explains why mine does not work 
extra add 
making my computer crash 
not purchase this again 
spend the extra money 
get a better quality adapter 
Hopefully that saves someone 
bought four 
got one to eventually work 
it would not pair 
returning the other three due 
keep the one 
it supports up 
when I opened the case 
bought this adapter to use 
have a brand new Dell Precision Tower 
running Windows 
followed the directions by installing 
uninstalled the software 
had no networking 
IPConfig showed no network adapters 
This does not make any sense 
time it chops a delay is added 
product did work well 
it connected 
hooked up another bluetooth adapter 
it worked perfectly 
adapter literally just works after you plug it in the computer , sort 
computer would crash during the driver installation , forcing 
paired something 
Windows 7 will install generic drivers 
BT working 
latency in my BT headphones build up 
Then I pair it again 
installed the drivers 
that came 
it could n't install the drivers for it , making 
downgrading this 
tried it 
Each worked 
finally found one computer 
pause a video , it would start building 
that seemed to work 
especially as it requires me to go 
returning a faulty product 
team replied 
that comes 
that suggests 
use the Toshiba trial drivers as opposed 
's a very helpful review 
Read the comments to see 
how to use it 
tried it 
yes , it works 
again , the mic on my headset wo n't register properly 
It works great 
that I do n't have to compromise 
still return it 
n't give this adapter every chance 
only does it completely fail to work 
quick Google suggests 
experience is far from isolated 
Amazon should absolutely remove this product 
also has a half 
which work perfectly fine 
running Windows XP 
device I tried it in 
light never lit 
Installed this on Windows 8 with connecting 
maintaining a connection 
then it started having 
it worked well enough 
It would just drop connection 
downloaded the SoundBot drivers 
connect the keyboard 
Uninstalled the drivers 
put a usb extender so that the SoundBot was within four inches 
n't waste your money 
Rarely finds a device ready 
When it does work 
Ive tried uninstalling 
Software comes 
CAPS , SCROLL , and NUM LOCK keys are toggled 
that displays 
provide the true file name 
It has disappeared since disabling 
that would spend hours mashing 
It did n't work 
what you pay for 
adapter caused an audio delay 
Adapter died 
engineer and I know 
It simply does n't work 
n't waste your time 
This does n't work half

It did not work with my windows 7 for playing 
It would connect 
It could see

Was NOT 
upgraded 3 PCs 
that stopped working 
it continues to work 
PC has a five year-old Bluetooth 2.0 USB adapter 
getting an updated Win 10 driver 
contacted SoundBot 
It did n't work 
Horrible drivers !! 
not get two units 
it worked perfectly 
Purchased another 
SoundBot is definitely crossed off my list 
bought this to go 
device makes 
sounds coming from it sound 
never had trouble 
it sounded just the same 
sure , I bought another headset 
So i moved the adapter 
getting another adapter 
buy it 
n't ever update your operating system 
how to connect anything

Kind of a pain to go 
It only lasted 3 months 
drivers cause it to not function 
great having a hard time getting multiple products syncd 
getting multiple products 
off , it crashed my computer when I turned 
using it to link 
it develops a fairly noticeable desync from whatever your audio source is 
it 's connected 
watching a youtube video , you can pause it 
get 2 or 3 seconds 
n't buy it 
how to use it 
Using the Windows 7 generic driver 
downloaded and installed the latest CSR driver 
it has way too much overhead 
it refused to also locate 
recognize a BT game controller 
bought this dongle for turned 
that will work 
uninstalled the software 
unplugged the dongle 
that never quite did the job , because since it actually did recognize 
useless bit of junk will go 
n't actually grow a plant 
not buy this 
nothing grow 
instructions came with it as 
well this works 
BOUGHT TWO 
AUTO !!!! LIAR 
WATER IS 
DO N'T BUY IT !!!! 
Mouse jumps 
It stopped working 
buttons werent bad 
when i plugged it 
dont know if there is 
work when i plugged it into my pc , dont know if there is any software for it but none of the buttons of the mouse works 
star due to the annoying double click 
that comes 
give it 
n't trust this company 
smoke was * coming out of the mouse * 
Then one morning it failed 
when I inspected it 
that seems to spontaneously catch 
EDIT 3/5/2017 
immediately sent a replacement mouse

Mouse has 
bind the mouse4 button 
ability to bind the mouse4 button to the generic mouse4 click 
left click stuck

i received the mouse 
it start disconnecting 
plugged it in for about 10 minutes just enough time 
almost smell the quality 
i suppose its time 
send it 
UTECHSMART!I have to say 
everything else fit 
pay a little more for something better and wait for shipping again thanks 
semi-comfortable the finger placement for my index and middle finger was spread out more 
enjoyed this mouse quite a lot 
minutes total using 
another but i do n't want to wait 
this did n't work out 
edit * forgot to mention i think the green led or w/e is in it was bad , it would just get a weird light blue color when i set 
i think 
green led 
buttons trigger other keys when spammed 
other commands are bound ' 1 
mouse has 
keys ` shift +1 
it would trigger commands 
spamming a mouse button 
same key binds manually 
not get the same result 
packaging was n't damaged 
got the mouse 
However , when I opened the box , the mouse wire was split 
basically threw my money away 
It does n't work 
pointer jumps all 
it jumps 
using it currently 
Only buy this 
Ill start 
click 1 side button 
pvp someone 
it would act 
send their support email 
apparently it has 
reviews its great item 
i have medium size hand 
mouse randomly choses keys to press 
click or use actives 
mouse would randomly think 
it had received 
viewed the negative ones 
Overall this mouse does actually have a really nice shape 
That 's where it stops 
clicks do feel 
give it time 
product did not even work 
mouse fly around 
Sometimes adding all the gimmicks 
also contacted the manufacturer 
used several multi-button gaming mice 
creature would not install properly 
not do a darn thing 
weird critter was not recognized 
returning the useless item 
had a Red Dragon mouse 
that functioned well 
hate this mouse 
wanted it to work 
gave it a serious try , because I was hopeful 
it immediately felt bad 
buttons were oily and slick -- the tiniest bit of oil off my thumb made it nearly impossible 
accidentally pressing buttons 
thumb kept on sliding 
That brings 
when there 's no audible indicator 
pressed the button 
button itself does n't click so much 
's not even much 
button was pressed 
It just does n't feel good 
wanted it to be my go 
buttons stopped working 
purchased it 
contacted the manufacturer 
lights still work 
have much cheaper mouses 
cost $ 37.99 
not recommend this mouse 
horrible the price says 
got this mouse 
it looked great 
opened the packaging 
Hooked it up to my computer , worked fine 
That 's until I started 
it feels more like you 're pushing 
right mouse button does n't go 
% sending this back 
it works fine 
update my review if I get 
stars is all you get 
which has worked much better 
Loses responsiveness mid play , I have a death adder razer and a logitech g502 I bought this since I feel 
bought this 
sometimes it stops responding 
Yes it has a lot 
get it where I wanted 
pretty bad get a more expensive one if you could 
never purchased this product 
need the extra buttons 
purchased this mouse because I like 
it would require the thumb size 
try to push one , I push 3-4 buttons 
one else has had this same problem?Now 
turn off all the lights 
packaged it back up nice 
It worked well enough but holy crap 
palming a small basketball 
It worked well while it worked 
replug it 
mouse stopped functioning 
tried it 
also tried it 
n't use the amazon 18-month warranty 
n't justify their claim just because it is from amazon warehouse 
bought it 
i make a small claim 
It has option 
it makes my hand very uncomfortable 
i ca n't get money back 
so i had to buy 
design could use better arch at top so you can lift 
when they move the mouse 
one has a terrible grip 
just to keep it 
comfort overpowers any feature 
IS PC ONLY 
NOWHERE IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION DOES IT SAY THE INSTALLATION SOFTWARE 
OWN A 
Wasted my time 
computer does n't recognize it 
bought it after reading 
Lesson learned 
not get another one 
that create a virtual `` valley 
that dip 
mouse has buttons 
thumb to search 
Not to mention the buttons 
that feels unnatural 
sent this back already 
height puts undue pressure 
that is made of is great 
Comes withextra Teflon foot pads 
Give a little more height 
said the same thing 
it makes my hand hurt 
Save your money

using my computer for a mere 5 days , it no longer moves the cursor 
scroll still works 
It feels great 
easily access all 
used it for a week and decided to return it because I believe 
s *** 
weights were already installed 
it was used instead of new 
which leads me to believe 
Also , the 12 button keypad does not work 
website does not offer viable help 
updates but the RAR file requires a act 
it has 
It says 
sent someone 's problem 
paid good money 
it would seem 
returning it 
Also , the act of returning it is made to where it is soooooooooo inconvenient 
time please 
just send me another mouse

it says 
it no longer works 
click button failed 
i wished 
it would have lasted alittle longer 
button no longer functioned

time spent researching 
program .5 switchable profiles 
MATTE FINISH like the photos suggest 
that everytime

which gets slippery

Mouse works 
what you pay for 
it replaced a standard two button 
mouse allows for customization of the palm rest and thumb hold 
that it effortlessly glides 
which I just thought 
replaced the mouse pad 
issues would manifest as the Y axis not responding , while still being able 
Typically these unresponsive times would last 
Honestly , while the issue was frustrating , I liked the mouse so I just accepted 
mouse just stopped powering 
Windows had detected an error 
It indicated 
This happened on several different PCs & Laptops , so it seemed 
then they shipped me another one 
then accepted a return 
contacted customer support 
It took about 2 to 2.5 weeks to go 
so I had less down time 
place a charge 
get a better experience 
line of `` tenaciously durable '' must only pertain to the switches supporting the left and right mouse buttons , because the sensor for movement tracking is pretty terrible 
supporting the left 
just buying a new one 
several other options to choose from that have to provide 
It gets a two star because it at least was nice 
it randomly stops working 
had it only a few months now 
used this mouse 
it had all the essential FPS buttons 
which I use 
that allows you to adjust 
gamer like me you should take note 
have a small hand 
which defeated the whole purpose 
switch DPI to lower 
n't much appreciate that 
claw grip 
who have small hands 
need one 
RGB LED 
far it has completely quelled all 
why : - You can adjust the weight 
so small hands/claw grippers can use it effectively 
download the Corsair mouse software to set 
say ditch 
It did n't look as nice when I got 
n't recommend it 
n't get this to work 
n't support it either 
version is n't supported 
need the pro version 
however it never loaded correctly 
purchased this version 
emailed the distribution company 
gave me some instructions 
that did not work 
someone email a copy so that I could sideload 
also contacted the author of the program and he was going to have someone email a copy so that I could sideload it on my kindle , however the never did 
Thus , I can not recommend this program as I could never get 
this devise 
Now error message shows on printer screen when using 
Save your money , missed return window 
that looks 
bought one 
It was delivered promptly 
more I can get USB cables 
second one did not work 
None of the 4 ports worked 
BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT 
DOES NOT WORK 
usb would n't pick 
it end 
It worked fine 
it would work on there either 
tried it 
product seems horrible 
doing a wrap 
Spend your money 
One of the two extra buttons is not working 
mouse seems to be a used one 
what 's going 
mouse worked fine 
sometimes it does n't 
so you drag it 
dpi keeps resetting 
which prevents from me to grab 
i have to lift 
Im keeping it though 
mouse works great , if you 're okay 
pop it back in 
mouse wo n't turn back on unless you physically remove 
on/off switch underneath does n't cut it 
stuck with my crappy $ 5 logitech wireless , it worked better 
Save your money 
one made it a whole month 
it worked pretty well 
It 's infuriating 
who have n't tested the things 
true reviews get buried 
Amazon needs to get 
Left Mouse button stopped working 
lesson learned

2months later , mouse connection has become spotty 
ordering a replacement

cable is braided 
it is dragging the mouse a lot 
which makes it very bad 
using it 
wrist hurts quite a bit

Unfortunately I can not return it , so it will have to rest on a shelf and collect dust , until I find 
product worked great until the right button began 
mouse lasted 
bought this 
it worked fine 
unfortunately it immediately the scroll wheel died 
it wo n't even move 
lost connection from the very start of using it , I did n't mind it so much 
it gradually became worse as I continued 
using it 
simply just tossed it 
What I thought 
What the seller -LRB- Hippidion -RRB- sent 
Also , it feels really cheaply constructed 
It has no rubber 
had a good grip 
that I paid slightly less for seem 
only paid $ 7 
definitely find a better mouse 
mouse does not move where i 'm moving 
bought this 
it does n't glide well 
It stopped working 
n't fit my hand very well 
Never could get it to connect 
Followed the instructions

knowbitbis a cheaper mouse 
i have bought mice 
Literally got it 
it stopped working three days later 
It moves the pointer 
time then freezes 
instructions complied 
Used two different new batteries 
Mouse has horrible grip , very hard 
work , buttons felt clunky 
It now has an internal rattleing feature 
mouse never came 
Piece of junk stopped working 
Mouse started to miss 
n't use it 
it fixed 
like it fixed , It does n't go down 
sensitivity comes 
get the receiver to start 
little bit it will just stop responding 
mouse will be stuck until you do 
internal connector fractured 
item arrived with the right mouse button completely broken 
it popped back 
overall design feels flimsy 
Some of that perception could come from it being so `` beat 
where the pinkie would rest 
it feels awkward 
Already have started the return process 
not get this mouse to function 
It did function 
computers only recognized 
port did not show as being used 
mouse sometimes did not track 
Had new battery 
mouse is not recommended 
scanner tells 
site is n't trusted 
Mouse was working fine 
now it is intermittently working 
once the mouse is replaced 
how their warranty is?I will update 
what you paid 
buttons have a nice click 
biggest gripe -- and the deal breaker -- is how awkward this mouse feels 
got pretty small hands 
then , I ca n't hold this mouse comfortably 
It seems designed for your index finger on the left click 
never known one to play like that , but it 's fairly comfortable in this position , though it feels 
relegated this mouse 
hands constantly slip 
fingers are left gripping 
constantly adjust and hindering the gameplay 
which forced me to decrease 
recommend the Gaming Mouse 
that replaced both this 
what I use now 
looked fine 
it had something 
lasted one week right mouse button stopped working 
deliver it 
side is sloped so steeply 
it forces the thumb 
requires continual attention 
avoid both these issues 
filled the resulting hole 
make the mouse usable , I pried out the two left side buttons 
colored it black 
sanded the surface smooth 
much fixed the comfort problem 
also sanded off some other sharp edges 
too-stiff cord remains 
which only reduces the usability 
TeckNet spent more 
mouse performed spectacular 
use it daily 
scroll down bottom just does n't work properly 
other mouse of cheaper design that take a beating and scroll down bottom still works properly 
that take a beating 
scroll down bottom 
Also I take care of my electronics and accessories so it was n't a drop damage 
Probably try another company , because sadly , the scroll bottom is very important 
other may stop working 
Unfortunately , doe not allow returns 
issued a full refund 
It looked 
it starts to make 
using the center wheel 
it will happen 
tried this 
clicking feeling 
tracking is not smooth 
n't suggest this 
buy $ 10 mouse again , I will buy logitech wired mouse 
n't hope good product 
wheel and dpi button both quit working 
actually likes the mouse 
considering my wife 
software does not work 
package installs 
mouse detected 
tried different USB ports , detecting 
It works 
n't register movement very well 
n't had this mouse 
Also , it 's made 
finally it bit the dust completely 
Worked for a little while , then my laptop would n't recognize it 
quickly developed cramping 
Used this mouse 
what the `` Extra Weight '' refers 
weight of my hand was triggering mouse clicks 
cursor would n't move 
it lit up fine 
it will click 
use the right 
surface the mouse was on the cursor would n't move 
left click , because if I lined up the cursor to click on something , with my previous mouse , and then plug in this new mouse it will click on it ; however , it did n't matter 
computer shut down 
it said 
when it restarted 
USB port demanded more power 
restarted my computer again 
directly below -LRB- that I use 
why that should have occurred besides the mouse being faulty 
when their email they send to follow up on their product says 
Well , I had already submitted a refund request 
try it 
it could automatically shut down too 
i had it 
It worked fine 
buttons are sticking 
Sometimes id have to pull 
it up to just getting a bad one because everyone else loves 
Weird mouse movement curve decelerates when I 'm trying 
It literally says 
it `` might not work smoothly 
Does that cover traditional smooth dark cloth mouse pads 
it does 
n't own a surface 
mouse can work successfully apparently 
It does not work 
Maybe I had a defective one 
tried it for about 10 minutes playing 5 different times constantly having 
playing 5 different times 
returned it 
Terrible mouse tracking , seems like the curser bobbles 
Bought a Mionix 
n't support trash manufacturers with a mouse like this , unless you use 
mouse would not move without wiggling 
Mouse feels like it 's worth 
uncomfortable in my hand and the buttons do n't feel very good 
better build quality 
tried other mice 
Primary mouse button failed 
Left-click button and DPI shift button are somehow connected 
releases it 
BOUGHT THE MOUSE TODAY 
that will give you carpel 
It was also poorly made 
right plastic clicker came undone 
Work for 2 week then the left mouse button stopped workinG 
working the left mouse button 
only register the click after I let 
clicks do n't register often 
who responded 
so I returned it 
Nothing worked 
It broke 
receiver wo n't get recognized 
smoothly like when I first used it 
it lasted 
flaws are blooming 
precision for gaming is starting to fail 
like it till it lasted , it worked 
has the potential 
mouse looks awesome 
ordering it 
Unfortunately it stopped working 
NOT recommend this mouse 
everything about this mouse sucks 
Mine was actually broken when i received 
it still sucks 
give it a shot 
wheel is got 
button go inside 
sometimes the USB does n't work as 
i have used 
i would not recommend it 
bought this product 
it felt good in my hand so I was excited 
it would be made 
give me an error when I would plug 
it still would n't work , so I figured 
gave it the benefit 
then tried it 
it would n't work either 
got the same error as I did 
USB device has malfunctioned 
wasted my money 
came the conclusion 
DO NOT RECOMMEND WIRELESS VERSION 
avoid this brand 
that connects the mouse 
not receive the USB 
Leaves this mouse completely useless 
tried 3 different brand new batteries 
It would constantly `` hit 
start cycling back 
even touching the back 
it would just take control 
lights , nothing , just stuck 
Then the DPI buttons began resetting 
it looks cool 
what you pay 
gave it 2 stars 
Works well but as a `` gaming mouse '' it performs 
that requires a lot 
playing a game that requires a lot of clicking , this mouse fails as some clicks will go 
WM289 Does not work 
returning ASAP 
it gets jerky 
Mouse feels okay 
moving the pointer 
it 's lousy put to use 
mouse seems like it 's good quality 
mouse worked fine 
tried a few cheapo mice 
just use it 
etc all included 
ordered a g402 after just 1 day with this POS .2 stars mainly just because it 's the best LOOKING mouse 
It does look sharp 
it does n't perform 
It definitely does n't feel 
Amazon is telling 
spent a little more and gotten a Logitech 
developed sporadic problems 
later , externally it looks 
which it was supposed to replace 
mouse has been used 
right click made a hideous grating sound 
clicked it 
have a MSI 970 motherboard 
it will not allow your PC 
MSI does n't know 
It will stick 
throwing this mouse away as it seems 
So in conclusion , I have no idea 
plugged in , the PC WILL NOT BOOT not even 
that affected motherboard 
only have 3 hard drives so I can only have 
PC now works fine with a different mouse , just like it used 
lights make my hands sweaty when I 'm playing 
i 'm just going to take 
it feels really uncomfortable 
mouse started out fairly nice 
liked the color 
change the dpi 
comfortable and the left click has already stopped working 
hardly used it 
Save your money 
get a better mouse 
However if you only need a mouse 
wanted a cheap replacement 
bought this mouse because my good mouse wore 
had pain 
using this mouse 
mouse forced your hand 
mouse was designed so that a right or left handed person could use 
person mentioned 
mouse should be designed to fit 
forcing your wrist and hand to be in a bad position 
It also has a very low profile 
had wrist 
ever when I used this mouse 
value your long term wrist , hand and arm health , do not get this mouse 
ordering a new mouse now 
reviews seem to be mentioning 
Unfortunately , my brother just got it in the mail a few minutes ago 
immediately noticed the sluggish 
Raise the DPI 
it moves faster 
Tried the Red Dragon mouse 
it had flared out sides 
mouse was shipped 
it slightly hangs the cursor 
bought this mouse because I thought , `` Hey , it says extra weight 
mouse has NO EXTRA WEIGHT 
that comes 
it looks as if there is 
MOUSE IS SO FRICKING UNCOMFORTABLE 
using your mouse 
pinky completely dragging 
it is awkwardly falling down the side 
not buy this mouse ever again 
recommend it to a friend to buy 
tried my friends 
that changes colors 
Mouse works fine 
it hurt my pinky a good bit 
when I used it 
it work 
return it 
Firstly I bought 3 of these 12-15 $ mice to try 
mouse obviously has very poor quality control 
buttons were sticking right 
Left and right main clicks also felt very light 
product would not stand up 
particular product gets a `` Stay Away '' rating 
so pressing button 
spend the money elsewhere 
given 3 star if it could have been 
it can not be returned 
mouse has a nice size 
how you ca n't turn off the lights 
mouse has NO GRIP 
laser will continue to track
