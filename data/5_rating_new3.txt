Using the product as I write

Thanks VicTsing 
exactly what I needed 
using this mouse 
wheel reacts nicely 
buttons have 
solid click \ feel 
mouse wakes up immediately by clicking 
using this mouse 
hope that 
saves battery life

wanted large mouse 
it has that 
that I have ever bought 
get this one 
Great product , superb customer service .1 -RRB- Plugged the usb connector 
it was working in moments with no issues .2 -RRB- These folks have 
that should have had two products 
mouse was missing 
ship me another one out right away 
later I found the original one 
accidentally placed it 
focus was on solving the issue 
pointing fingers 
prefer an on/off switch 
purchasing some 
had issues 
even has the finger Grove 
setting makes a huge difference when switching 
give it a shot 
Ca n't believe 
easy this makes the use 
Great mouse for the price , You ca n't beat it 
highly recommend it 
change my review rating 
recommend it 
also recommend it to my supervisor to purchase 
it would take to replace 
It actually works better that 
what I mean 
It just makes it super convenient 
that feature 
clickers on the left closest to the rolling ball makes whatever website 
when I first got it 
wheel made a really annoying click 
went away pretty much all the way 
using it 
Otherwise works fine 
strongly recommend it 
Loved my old wired trackballs 
used a laser mouse 
using one 
Saw a friend 
have the ball 
It definitely keeps me from moving 
use it the better I 'm getting 
almost gave it 4 stars because it does n't seem 
how to use it thing than the mouse itself as I have noticed 
it lasts as long 
added functionality 
It relieves alot 
clean the rollerball sensors 
owned many 
Smooth and it fits 
do a lot 
using the trackpad 
hand started hurting 
It was becoming a real problem 
needed a solution 
who do 
n't have carpel tunnel 
had 0 hand pain since buying 
purchased a mouse of with a wrist pillow as one reviewer suggested 
need it 
buy this mouse now 
put this on the arm of his chair or on his own leg to operate 
setting it back down closer 
picking it 
use it with my laptop so works 
Try that 
bought my first mouse of this type more than 5 years ago 
Getting used to it took me a couple 
that I bought 5 years ago 
that cost more than USD 
has nothing 
It seems 
Easy to use , long battery life 
worn two 
i will never buy any other mouse again 
it works great 
Saves millions 
thumb do the walking instead 
Ordered this as I love 
mouse works great 
It comes with the Logitech Unifying Receiver so I can connect 
just plug it 
definitely recommend this 
rests parts 
that ache a bit 
user it takes a while to get used 
have these 
when it comes 
used an M305 
it started to crap 
It does feel cheaper 
it looks 
some getting used 
trackball does get 
click Alt 
fact that I do n't have to move my cursor to the back button on my browser or click Alt + left arrow makes this trackball a keeper 
left arrow 
kinda looks 
It also looks nice 
not express enough how great these mice are 
that do not want to suffer 
fingers do the rest 
arm just sits 
It has two programmable keys 
that lasts 
that can be programmed to control 
receiver can befit 
n play meaning 
it works 
just plug it in 
software needed 
still have not found a mouse 
Logitech does not quit making them until they come 
trackball has good range 
Mice do n't work well 
It should last a 
drop it 
Great , I own two 
pushing mouse all 
Just makes sense 
Have a couple 
that have lasted 
bought an additional one so I could have 
had the same one 
mouse works wonderfully smooth 
This works perfectly as expected 
programmed the extra side buttons to operate 
which has no room left for arm movements since I 've purchased 
it !! 
Really what I wanted 
Waited a good while 
Previous wireless ate 
have it 
Rollerball with thumb takes a little getting used 
Had a couple 
take strain 
mouse would help 
eventually took the dive 
not regretted it 
purchased it 
this took a day or so to get used 
use a mouse daily 
have no complaints 
Overall the quality of the item is as expected 
hand fits naturally 
it sussed 
Initially it took a couple 
however now a normal mouse feels unnatural 
it can fit easier 
not use the shortcut keys 
limit my use 
recommending this item 
have no problems 
that so many others still use 
often find this mouse 
use it 
give two thumbs 
it so far - Feels solid 
bought this a number of times as I 've killed 
mouse click 
always used the traditional arm 
moving , carpal tunnel 
causing ball or laser mouse 
This has changed everything 
using just the thumb 
downloading the app 
Easy to use comfortable and best of all my arm never moves 
use comfortable 
Say good bye to pain 
use it 
recommend it 
use it 
that just works 
put it back down 
cord broke 
eventually used it so much 
n't have that problem 
already using a year 
few users complain 
causing double-clicks 
still give it 5 stars 
things considered 
remapped the up button on the mouse to serve 
have no trouble at all getting 
that prefer these market limited products 
buy a wired version if they had 
spin the ball 
scroll the wheel 
that you slide around -LRB- you should see 
that sounds 
that went away when he started 
it mastered 
had hand wrist 
that has a logitech keyboard already 
have two computers 
moved the older 
new one i used 
trackball works perfect along with it all through a single receiver which is very handy for my tv in living room ... Highly recommend 
who does not speak so highly 
used everything ever 
also have 30 years 
Loved this 
Everyone else charges 2X 
check that before giving 
clean the dust balls out , so make 
What can I say

Great trackball , very comfortable , works well

Using a mouse 
arm does n't wear out trying 
using these Logitech M570s 
Just needed another one 
Works just like I hoped 
always get this kind 
which is primarily what I got it 
It has made playing 
it stays out of the way with the addition of there being no cords because it 's wireless 
size helps 
wider base allows my ring & pinky finger tendons to rest 
Previous unit started to balk 
Mouse works great - replacement

When I originally purchased the Logitech wireless trackball mouse 
caught a really good deal 
small hand held trackball mouse 
that died 
constant moving of a regular optical mouse was beginning to wear 
had carpal tunnel surgery many years ago 
not say enough good things 
It does take some time 
resisted the wireless trackballs 
buying used Logitech trackballs on eBay whenever I would wear 
Logitech - bring back the trusty old wired trackball 
bought this one 
So I bit the bullet 
batteries just seem to keep 
used the old tried & true wired version , this one will not disappoint 
Took a few hours 
still prefer the wired version 
loved it 
found this at Amazon I jumped right 
connecting a cord

current one is used

it only takes a few seconds 
turned many people 
one has ever liked it right away 
some getting used

that had a ball 
one set up instantly 
hang go this one 
Great product loved it 
using this 
Just what I needed 
trackball works great 
little getting used to , but once you get the hang 
have these 
battery will last over a year without ever shutting 
do a fair amount 
never buy a standard mouse again 
using this mouse since the first one made 
The prefers this particular trackball 
n't experience muscle spasms 
Now , I can use this trackball 
not require much 
prefer a trackball to a mouse because I find 
moving my whole arm 
move fingers 
trackball has great functionality 
It takes a little to get used to , if you 've never used 
MOVEMENT OF THE CURSER IS DRIVEN BY 
THIS ENABLES FINER CONTROL 
WOULD N'T USE PHOTOSHOP 
puts it 
takes all the pressure 
later it 's still working 
some getting used to because it is n't like 
it helps 
wrist was really hurting 
this decreases 
pain and the pain pretty much is gone 
had no problems 
Took a while 
purchased it 
using it for a couple days , it proved to be easier 
's no comparison 
trackball does n't need to be moved 
use it 
rest the trackball on you leg 
rest it 
use it 
often do computer work outside in the cold while testing 
simply drop the trackball 
operate it 
pointer moving with out me doing 
fingers moving 
move my pointer telepathically 
have one 
it !!! 
it has a unifying receiver 
which allows me to use 
n't buy anything else 
battery is still going strong 
it replaced 
some getting used to but great for presenting 
who works long hours 
tried a Logitech touchpad 
having some rsi 
Tried this 
clean the sliders 
that about once a month you have to pop 
left a hole 
Logitech clearly knows this 
stick a pencil through to pop 
wife loves this track ball 
using a trackball thumb marble 
LOVE LOVE it 
It has the side effect 
using your computer when you accidentally leave 
it unlocked with Failover Cluster Manager open 
having difficulty 
do a lot 
just wiggle your fingers 
Took a minute 
that makes it a bear 
use an external mouse 
Windows 10 and Windows 7 had 
issues picking it 
have zero RF receiver dongle 
taking up a valuable USB port 
only desire would be for the trackball to support Bluetooth , so 
sticking off my laptop to worry 
HAVE WORN OUT IN 5 YEARS LOVE 
used Logitech 
n't have a lot 
need some time 
design expire as it is ideal 
had an older version 
it lasted 
cord finally broke 
enjoying it 
Drivers installed almost instantly 
back/forward buttons work 
chose it 
Most people do n't use trackballs , so they never try 
wife continues to use 
used the corded Microsoft Trackball Explorer 
However , the cord is coming loose , causing 
trackball itself roll away 
Also , I 've dropped it 
never again find anything quite as comfortable 
It took a month 
reading reviews to settle 
had some initial confusion 
rolling the trackball 
now all it does is left clicks and wheel scrolling 
latter sometimes feels `` demoted 
dropped this one too 
ball does n't come out unless I really want 
wife finally breaks hers 
Meanwhile my old Trackball Explorer is waiting 
mouse I use with my tablet has a scroll wheel 
that tilts from side-to-side , activating 
M570 does n't 
It comes with software to reassign 
it wo n't reassign my fourth Mouse Button to `` open Windows menu '' the way 
Finally , I would prefer a Bluetooth version 
when my computer has something already built in?Nevertheless 
give this product five stars 
highly recommend it 
recommend it 
needs no wire 
had a wired mouse similar 
The have gotten ridiculously expensive 
n't use it 
use it often 
Easy to use 
loved it 
thing works great 
Then , I found this one 
Wireless so you can set it anywhere and not have to worry about moving it around , just have 
Just takes some getting use to if you 're use 
n't have any other mouse , abruptly the best 
use this

old logitech wired trackball 
it does n't move 
take a while to get used 
bought this 
always used a trac ball 
also use it 
use it daily 
have carpal tunnel symptoms 
collecting dirt 
n't even used all the features 
use it 
needing an occasional cleaning 
never had a single problem other 
prefer these over a mouse any day as I have 
use it anywhere 
Using it now 
bought 3 
buy an extra just in case they stop 
have soooo many of these now 
use it 
how this thing has made my life 
n't even have the words for how this thing has made my life better 
Someone recommended this type 
why anyone would use a conventional mouse after trying 
use the ball 
It did take a couple of days to quit 
just leave it where it sits 
change things 
thumb does all the moving , while your middle-finger can turn 
zoom in/out 
hand rests pretty comfortably 
one serves to go 
it works 
one is needed 
i have ever owned 
movement implies less stress 
Perfect for multi monitor setup as one can move 
Meets my needs perfectly 
smaller wireless connector stays 
also use a conventional mouse 
Using a variety 
minimizes hand and wrist strain 
it operates flawlessly 
delivering thanks 
little getting used 
Ive been using the Trackman Mouse 
not buy a Trackman 
old ones had 
paid a premium on ebay to get

where the Kensington batteries might last 
really enjoy the ergonomic feel 
Easy to set-up , and the battery lifetime seems to be relatively long 
indicator shows near-full 
some getting used 
wrist thinks 
slow down the pointer speed 
Logitech makes the best and most durable stuff 
build up dust 
moving the mouse around 
where it sits on the points inside 
All you have to do is just pop out the ball 
changed the battery 
really ca n't remember the last time 
Ergonomically it fits my hand perfectly thus reducing 
play WoW

actually it should handle up to 6 Logitech `` unifying '' devices 
that 's ever had `` carpal tunnel '' syndrome 
replace my aging Microsoft 5 button 
found use 
everyone take a turn 
have 2 mouse interfaces for playing games like civ , that require 
paired it 
playing games 
It makes it much easier to pass 
It takes a little getting used 
it seems to be fairly good 
using two of these mice at the moment , one 
already bought a third 
had the first mouse 
it is still running strong 
replaced the battery a few weeks ago 
using this particular style 
it has greatly reduced the strain 
using a corded track ball at work so I 'm use 
When my non trackball home computer mouse `` Logitech M705 '' started having left 
limited space 
use this with out having 
mouse has all the features 
moving a typical mouse around 
someone would remake the microsoft rollerball 
it fit my hand better 
use it daily 
battery lasts well 
used several hours 
bought a second one 
something ever happens 
It get five stars 
bought two 
both have been working 
which causes more pain 
which puts my sore shoulder 
move the cursor 
Using this mouse 
it 's going to be discontinued 
buy a spare one soon 
awesome track ball will truly enjoy this item 
had this same mouse 
some getting used to , once you 've got 
trackball takes 
not moving my entire hand/arm around to navigate 
bought this on my doctors recommendation as I kept 
None the less this is the second of these I have had , I lost the other 
find a travel size 
recommend this trackball 
that I bought somewhere else 
operate a normal mouse 
n't have the space 
thumb also click the button 
Other trackballs make 
Still using it 
quality just stands 
used their trackballs 
Perfect for use do CAD work 
never move my hand 
It lets 
So my hand is not hurt 
Just what I needed 
when using this mouse 
that tells you the excellent 
used this track ball before 
using a Logitech M570 
old one finally wore out 
It takes a little bit to get used 
it works great 
using this trackball 
highly recommend it 
who have wrist/hand pain 
who are working 
n't need a large mousing surface 
used this model 
have one 
wireless version has excellent tracking 
store the receiver in the base if you take 
different feeling than common mouse , feel better 
always loved trackballs 
i wanted to get 
has back and forward buttons 
ball glides 
it still has over 400 days left 
life looks like it will last 
wake up process takes 
trackball goes into a sleep state when it idles 
im getting used 
works welll 
i can move around the photos quickly 
Just what the doctor ordered 
ad planned 
Had a wired version when I was much younger 
took less than 10 seconds 
Install was a snap 
has trouble on start up so you have 
it started 
it 's worked great me for me so far 
had it 
missed my old logitech trackball 
packing it 
3rd one in 10-15 years , the left click button keeps going 
Does the job 
one works just fine 
use it 
these go 
what it 's supposed to 
use it to switch 
it 's never had a problem 
Use this 
far has worked great right 
Still using this 
how I no longer have arm ache after using 
reduced the price 
one dies 
Might have to get 
Liked it enough to buy 
have two systems 
so two keyboards plus a Wacom tablet an iPad Pro 
which requires space to move 
not be dropping the trackball 
throw rocks 
loved it 
It will take practice and time to learn 
still need more practice to get 
Otherwise , the product works great 
use it 
It makes navigating 
battery lasts a long time 
use this 
that it feels 
great mouse , my hand does n't hurt now 
using thumb to move 
used this type 
migrating mouse 
Use this 
where the trackball far surpasses a mouse 
bought this trackball based on SO many reviews 
who were using it prior 
never actually purchased one 
now used this trackball 
trying it 
where I do not have much desk space 
hitting the track pad 
spend so much time using 
requires less desk space 
read several review comments 
experienced this 
simply rubbed the ball 
So I removed the ball 
Maybe I got a bit 
this definitely made a difference 
almost preferred the LESS smooth surface 
have quite a tendency 
What I found 
try it out , first 
want it to be smoother , you can easily make that modification 
who have never used this type 
Alot of people do n't seem to like 
no moving the mouse everywhere 
wireless '' lag like j have seen 
This works quite well 
not change the sensitivity 
keep it from sliding 
g. Using the additional buttons to adjust 
probably noticed lol 
what I think 
i 've replaced them because I lost 
buy another one 
that kept it level 
little pads that kept it level are gone 
wobbling is annoying 
receiver in the device itself would barely work 2 feet away ... so it was time 
dies , i 'll buy another one 
This works great , very long battery life 
that never turn it 
that comes 
It even has a clever little storage space 
had bones 
hitting bones 
this helped out so much 
ball spins nice and quick , the button are extremely responsive 
place it where with out the space limitation 
wireless dongle can fit in side of the battery section while traveling 
Why move your hand while just move 
owned this type of mouse 15 years ago 
Now I can sit on my couch and work no problem 
use the buttons 
move the ball 
using the thumb 
Battery lasts forever 
had it 
use it 6-7 hours a day weekly 
i did 
this took a bit of adjustment as the trackball is thumb controlled 
pain is finally gone after using 
it would be to get 
bought 2 
Loved this one so much 
had it a 
use it 
bought two 
buttons started randomly double-clicking 
sometimes the cursor would stop highlighting 
Also , the button would n't register as ` depressed 
Repairing it 
that does n't hurt my fingers 
create a carpal tunnel flare 
control it 
lasts long , it works great 
It keeps my coworkers away 
also get amusement from them scooting 
whole family loves these 
left-handed husband uses one , too 
have one for every computer , and two that are in my computer travel bag , so they 're everywhere I need 
why people use the more common mouse that is such a pain on your hands , moving 
have no clue 
wrist gets fatigued 
feel the difference 
it also has a scroll wheel as some ergo mouses do 
one died 
picked up another with the protective case to try 
credit its death on how it was transported 
it arrived super quick 
using Logitech 's version 
have large hands 
It is perfectly refined these days to fit 
Just plug it in 
everything works fine without downloading 
differently you will need the software 
buttons on the top left serve for forward and back while browsing 
set the trackball on an armrest and surf away 
it is sitting there lol 
have two 
never had a problem 
bought this as a backup for my other M570 , 5 years

own at least 4 
batteries really do 
connection between the mouse and the keyboard absolutely never drops 
liked it

had absolutly 0 switch trouble 
fancy and I certainly have different purchasing criteria 
It lives up to its promise 5 years and I am only on the second pair 
wireless mouse are created equal 
one goes over my couch and thick carpet just fine 
It fits in my hand perfectly 
Exactly what I wanted 
why we bought it 
use this 
extra hidden button that opens up every active window like Macs do 
that opens up every active window 
do a lot 
using this mouse 
also use it at home when I remote 
original batteries included 
used this mouse exact mouse 
batteries was still working 
Then I got a new one just because why not 
use this mouse daily and highly recommend it 
it was highly recommended 
that does n't have the 
use only one 
It has a button 
release the clicks 
good little mouse should do 
It features a very long battery life 
does everything 
that I do Cad on 
bought this mouse 
It gets a lot 
leave it 
that comes with it is nice 
it is going to be bumped 
not had it long enough 
batteries will still last 
leave it 
definitely would recommend this item 
needed a replacement 
opened it 
left button was starting to go 
right button was starting to flake 
repaired '' it 
n't make that model anymore 
M705 comes darn 
battery is supposed 
causes the forward/back buttons not to work 
removed the software 
mouse lasts as long 
exactly as I expected it to be 
perfect wireless mouse , no need to worry about batteries anymore , gets drooped couple 
dropped the first one 
first one lasted 
it finally broke 
husband discovered this model of mouse several years back 
now purchased three 
use these all day everyday 
person might possibly use a mouse 
not have the extra buttons 
use all the buttons 
that we have become 
how they managed that 
husband has this 
purchase one also 
allows some button mapping 
using it right now 
has well over 100,000 miles 
still have this model 
Feels solid 
that 's 
what she said 
It 's beginning to show 
it does n't seem to be breaking 
highly recommend this if you need 
use this mouse 
how it fits 
This was purchased to replace 
how you can use the button below it to make 
roller glide or click depending 
some knock off versions out there 
n't have the same weight 
used this 
it fits my hand 
ever used ordinary 2-button 
what the top button did 
which was solved by figuring 
which just took a little getting used 
n't use the additional buttons on the thumb side as I 've not thought 
that worked great 
gamer , I use my mouse 
need it to be comfortable 
Logitech complies 
has a lot 
built , medium sized 
that travels well 
particularly like how it works 
which allows me to pair 
liked this mouse so much 
bought a second one to leave 
it 's become my favorite after trying 
used this model 
actually wore the first one out as the left click button broke 
works perfedt 
used it to replace 
which still works fine 
M705 has a little better handling 
moving your hand 
Also , the scroll wheel can be pushed to move 
fit the unifying receiver 
asked my guys 
only they could `` fix '' it 
Well , when I clicked to discern what all those devices were , the list just included duplicates 
mouse feels good 
use the free wheel to virtually fly 
bought a `` used 
It fits my hand really well 
co-worker had this mouse 
immediately bought one 
It has places 
it will operate 
It worked great , very smooth 
looking for a mice with long battery life and smooth functions , this might work well 
replaced the mouse 
it feels a little too large 
friend had recommended it 
comfortable mouse i have ever used 
used this mouse 
programmable buttons save me a lot 
only use Logitech 
husband loves it 
got him a laptop 
preferred a mouse 
bought a second one after my first was stolen 
It fits perfectly 
right on target , no `` where did that curser go 
never had connection issues 
Love the mouse , have been using 
First pair of batteries lasted almost 5 years 
mainly because i did n't use it regularly 
Second pair lasted 
Easy to use 
already own several 
have one 
which got dropped 
have somewhat small hands 
find the size of this mouse very comfortable 
What impresses me most is 
set of batteries can last 
Also you can use this mouse with only one battery , if you 're concerned 
what Logitech had to offer 
have small hands 
this feels great 
dont have to remove 
had several editions 
have a complaint 
work it hard , darn 
perhaps I should expect this 
always replace it 
it always does the job superbly 
using three 
now had this mouse 
use it 
n't sense any 
buy it again 
gave it 
used a ton 
got this one because it is advertised 
bought this mouse 
it July 2016 as of this writing -RRB- and the battery is only down to 90 % , even after all the times I have forgotten to turn 
fit your hand well 
using a Logitech M505 mouse 
which I was using 
ordered this 
assign Windows functions 
highly recommend it 
Great , I own several 
dropped this mouse more 
it still works great 
It has the perfect fit 
not use a mouse without it now 
flywheel gets old 
mouse does not seem to have 
which makes your mouse much , much lighter .4 
mouse has 
put that button 
literally could not stand it 
It was like trying to use 
It almost ruined a great mouse 
which showed 
remove that button 
how you can carefully take this mouse apart 
where you can break things 
see places 
So I 'm taking a star 
had all sorts 
n't break it 
Just what I needed 
had this mouse 
mouse has a solid build 
purchased this mouse for use with my laptop and like that it 's small enough to easily stow in my bag while still being large enough 
n't experience any cramping 
n't notice any appreciable lag 
caveat though is I experienced some occasional errant movements while using 
currently own a Logitech G502 Proteus Gaming Mouse 
G502 also has the dual-mode scroll wheel 
Logitech carried this handy feature 
software also offers great flexibility in altering 
recommend this mouse 
buy it again 
Needed a new mouse 
it is just as advertised 
batteries last 
it does n't feel cheap 
Doing very good job 
Replaced a 4 year old same model

which I loved 
previously purchased an M

never turning the mouse 
not supporting the back button 
back mouse button does n't work 
use this mouse 
show previews 
n't use the button 
find that 
disable OR reprogram 
old Kingston mouse finally died 
bought two wildly different mice 
flexible Logitech M705 is my new `` go 
Well , I quickly discovered the trackball design drives 
so this mouse fits my hand perfectly 
chunky M705 might feel awkward 
mouse takes one OR two AA batteries 
it works great 
it feels too heavy 
It also uses the superior 2.4 GHz wireless technology as opposed 
number of reviews about the M705 switches 
have an issue , I will post an immediate update 
bought a dozen 
bought it 
use it 
It feels good 
never have wireless issues 
which made it more light weight 
remove one of the batteries as another reviewer suggested 
thing is I wish 
com recommended great mouse 
bought another 
n't believe it 
who has come to like 
which I kept pressing 
disabled the `` Application Switcher '' button 
Does everything 
mouse!I can use this mouse while sitting 
using Windows machines 
reading emails 
highly recommend it 
otherwise it works well 
Running OS X El Capitan 
customized the two thumb buttons 
LOVE THIS MOUSE 
adjust my mouse settings -LRB- speed and acceleration -RRB- to match 
It took me a while 
Customize the two thumb buttons 
It will change your life 
it does everything 
need it to do 
Logitech keeps this model 
OMG why did I wait this long to get 
take either of the batteries out and operate it off of one AA rather than two AA in order to customize 
operate it 
battery does seem 
bought my first one of these over a year 
Good mouse , got another one 
medium sized lady hand too 
loves it 
bought this 
especially like how the mouse wheel can be `` switched 
Bought a wireless mouse 
mouse follows my every move 
use it 
simply add batteries 
Stick in doggle ... then go after windows finds 
mouse works great 
even though I use it 
got a keyboard 
Ca n't say anything bad 
own two 
employers buy this model 
It works 
really like that I can program its buttons and wheel to be 
doing region screen 
hidden '' thumb button for doing region screen captures 
whatever you want 
it send keystrokes 
that switch desktops 
wheel tilts left 
it silently `` click '' as you move 
button just behind the scroll wheel -LRB- dis -RRB- engages a detent mechanism so you can spin 
how to disable the lower thumb button 
This is my go 
It tracks precisely 
has a great feel 
do VFX Work 
bought this to replace 
It works really well 
that I have tried 
personalize the buttons 
that streamlines my productivity greatly 
bought my first one back 
it 's still going strong 
Just bought another one 
Battery lasts forever , great wireless range 
use it 
use my computer 
little USB dongle works 
leave the miceon 
unpacking my computer 
So I leave the dongle 
dongle works 
bought this to replace 
use the mouse with one battery if you want 
n't replaced the battery yet 
snag this version on discount , its still by far the most comfortable laptop mouse design Logitech has ever made 
i know 
made a product revision and its a new version now 
a must have 
Great fit for my hand ... works very well 
get the full experience 
Read the instructions 
what I call 
that allows me to switch 
precision scrolling 
Anyway , I bought four 
mouse hits 
breaks , I 'll buy another 
it is still working perfect 
using it a while 
Good News is I 've been using 
this a while now and it still works perfect 
want a mouse 
what I was looking for when I was reading 
took a chance 
recommend this 
have an identical keyboard/mouse setup 
move my CPU tower back and forth without having 
left mouse button began to double 
replacement was easily linked 
Wonderful product seems to makes 
hand and the cursor seamlessly come together 
Fits my hand well and easy to use 
had one previously 
stopped working after several years I replaced it 
Installed a pair 
mouse is used 
Short versionThe mouse has perfect functionality 
had this mouse 
tried out the large Logitech mouse 
typical one most people go 
put the bluetooth adapter on your computer and leave it there , you should n't lose it 
leave it there 
always get a replacement 
section of the mouse has a slit 
mouse does lose the logitech logo 
mouse gets 10 starts , only if I could rate 
use it 
had this mouse once before 
it was starting to wear 
it took 4 + years of daily use before the buttons stopped 
batteries last 2-3 years -LRB- I turn it off when I 'm not using 
when this one wears out , if the same model is still being made 
it just works 
battery I 'd used lasted at least 1 year + 
THIS IS A GREAT MOUSE 
n't replaced a battery 
Most others have hurt on the sides after gripping 
one does n't do any 
purchased this mouse a few weeks ago 
review it 
who sometimes holds one 
It should be noted 
mouse has just enough to keep me satisfied without confusing my fingers : two primary buttons 
where your thumb rests 
what I would use it for , thankfully logitech 's downloadable software solves 
what this button will do ?! 
replaces it 
secret button seemed rather silly 
mouse feels as it moves 
which requires a lot of use with the mouse , including holding 
who care 
use a 3D graphics program 
Understandably , a mouse must have a very certain `` feel '' to it as I move 
button does n't resist too much 
It moves smoothly 
enough that I do n't accidentally spin it while pressing 
what I need it to be 
found this first 
get a decent mouse 
bought another Logitech wireless mouse 
liked the freedom on not having 
n't getting a tactile response 
that I 've used 
it turned a little too freely 
had a hard time 
scrolling pages 
n't have enough control 
did a search 
that had a more `` clicky '' wheel 
lot of the reviews I read seemed to sound 
that you can engage to make 
it an have been using it 
Button to engage the clicky-ness works well 
engage the clicky-ness 
that I do n't accidently hit 
that had a wheel 
Especially if the battery lasts 3 years like it claims 
long have I been using this now 
computer is hooked up to the TV now 
had no problems 
it is working as designed 
little getting used 
highly recommend it 
bought 3 
travel so I am hard on wireless products 
cant be beat 
It allows a ratcheting mouse wheel 
want to swing from the bottom of a page to the top , I can hit the toggle 
normally use it 
spin the wheel 
it goes all the way 
working non stop 
have quite a few logitech gaming mice 
which chew 
One of them eats a battery 
mouse however just keeps 
n't buy it

Logitech makes excellent mice 
Replaced my Logitech MX Revolution 
use the mouse while it is charging 
first one had a scroll wheel 
replacement is holding out just fine 
that stopped working 
batteries required

Commanding control 
Logitech makes the best mouses 
so what can I say more

accurate , great design , fully customizable to no end and rechargeable !?! Win , Win 
some getting used 
Good mouse , takes 
small buttons next to where your thumb rests are set 
pulling my hand off to reach

i would recommend this 
white gets 
dirty i have to clean 
i switched 
bought this mouse 
skipped the Performance 
that was supposed to be a successor 
buttons on the MX Master took me a day 
It has all 
containing a left and right click button 
form that , it has the free scroll 
mouse will run 
put it 
use it daily 
plugged it 
it had a full charge again 
while was using it 
touching a keyboard 
safe to say the MX Master is the CADILLAC of mice!If you spend 2000 + hours a year touching a keyboard and mouse , should n't you put a little thought 
spend 2000 
mason uses 
carpenter uses a quality hammer 
trowel , a master carpenter uses a quality hammer and saw , a master chef uses a quality knife , should n't you use a quality keyboard 
chef uses a quality knife 
it 's for scrolling horizontally 
use it while it charges 
Hover in this price , I will be expect some box 
Responsive , comfortable and a good button configuration thats easy to use 
pay as much 
has a nice weight 
this was going to be too big 
n't downloaded the customization software 
had an old mouse 
that had side buttons 
accidentally pressing the side buttons because I do n't have 
it does n't actuate unless you give 
connections for this mouse are exactly what I needed 
One of my computers does not have bluetooth so I use 
that was included 
it saves three connections 
have my laptop 
using bluetooth without having 
also my laptop doesnt have the old standard usb connections so I am forced 
got it 
thing runs forever 
charge it 
use it 
which makes it nice 
mouse has a nice shape 
Downloading the ` Logitech Options ' software 
rebind the keys/buttons 
lock/toggle the middle scroll wheel 
really like how it shows all of the open windows so that I can switch 
how it knows which window 
had the Logitech Performance MX mouse previously 
that allows me to quickly switch 
having the bluetooth option

Lasts looooong time , much more

not use conventional mouse anymore 
hands are more relaxed now 
customize every button 
when you have other Logitech devices 
It is better using the Bluetooth 
which will reinvent your interface preferences 
buttons behind the horizontal scroll wheel feel cheap 
still remember my first Logitech mouse 
free-spin mode allows the user to , with a flick of a finger , smoothly and efficiently scroll 
fantastic scroll wheel , I 'd still recommend it 
that make this mouse fully deserving 
Fortunately for us , there 's a lot more features

Logitech has this technology called SmartShift where if you scroll

exactly how I wanted it 
it switches 
PC 's 
had 3 MX Performance mice 
then use 3 mice 
use my KVM to switch 
that every logitech mouse seems 
found the MX Master 
couple of the mice got the eventual problem that every logitech mouse seems to after about 3 years , where the left or right mouse button does not always activate on the first try , so I went 
where the left or right mouse button does not always activate 
What intrigued 
Have had it 
instead use a Logitech unifying dongle 
put this 
used the same unifying receivers 
always , Logitech has the best mix 
that does n't have the beautiful scroll wheel functionality 
never , EVER , buy another mouse 
it switch to `` free spin '' automatically 
it does n't go off while just resting 
i can bind them to whatever i want 
unfortunately it does n't work all that well 
it straight up does n't work 
it goes WAAAY too fast/slow 
it seems 
then another site will suck donkey balls 
site will work fine 
So i really think 
set app specific settings 
mice need to use 
HATE the `` claw '' grip everyone seems 
poor pinky gets so tired 
that it comes with 
when using it 
that it came 
have no problems at all when using 
it just never showed

it gets an insane amount 
then it goes back to lagging 
It eventually stops lagging 
needed/deserved a second computer screen 
much you need it 
deserve a luxury mouse 
Come on , you will use it

wireless fits very well 
that lets 
scroll side-to-side 
it lets

had a WOW special edition Logitech mouse 
programable buttons make it great 
have large hands so it fits 
It interfaces very well with Mac OS X using 
originally just using Bluetooth 
that cured the problem 
When it does get 
low recharging is fast 
it can be used while recharging 
mouse works wonders 
when the software works 
missing it 
which I end up using 
spin the wheel , you get free-flying scrolling 
mode where if you turn the wheel slowly you get traditional click-by-click scrolling 
using it 
mouse looks very good 
Personally , I find the horizontal scroll wheel 
pressing only one 
rather have no horizontal scroll wheel and bigger buttons instead 
assigning functionality 
come quite a way 
Luv it 
Everything works well , should last 
adaptive scroll wheel will take some getting use to , however , it really helps 
Most laptops has bluetooth function

disable the adaptive scrolling right away 
infamous scroll wheel issue happens 
right click 
seems a little too easy 
holding the mouse 
time will tell if the mouse is durable 
n't find it with my thumb without looking 
use it like a wired mouse until it recharges 
plug it 
Just what I was looking 
use this 
use it 
fingers do n't touch the mouse pad 
it glides effortlessly 
even used it 
all said 
battery die 
had a bran new mouse 
So I contacted Logitech 
it plays games OK 
n't really noticed any input lag on this mouse as opposed 
use this 
everyone has loved it after I let 
lot of people ask questions about the mouse because it stands 
hold it 
it just wekrs 
had this 
scroll unlocks 
considering the fact 
which has proven to be very effective 
one on the MX unlocks automatically after giving 
G502 practically never stopped spinning 
This unlocks scroll 
have a lot more friction relative 
how to bind it to zoom 
it works fairly well as 
Always loved this mouse 
use it 
it feels substantial 
left and right button click 
free-wheeling scroll wheel is easily changed 
which the thumb can easily operate 
It worked perfectly right 
also have high hopes for long battery life since it is a lithium battery 
instantaneously and unpredictably while moving the mouse around 
previously purchased the cheaper optical mice 
two of them had a substantial problem 
skipping ' large amounts 
This happened so frequently 
using it for about a week now 
it has not skipped even once 
update this review if I have 
mouse is charged 
low , I plug it 
it is charging

not used it with multiple machines as I do n't want

which I find useful 
button on the bottom of the mouse let 's 
have the 1st mode 
get more use 
This means 
software makes it easy to pair 
it also has a battery low notification 
what I was concerned 
back button is easily accessed 
it does n't matter 
use the back button much more frequently 
which uses regular batteries 
that needs regular charging 
many applications do n't support it so it does n't really matter 
it includes one if you need 
It can also pair 
's a button at the bottom along with indicator lights to switch 
used many different ones 
one seems to fit 
reviews that state this mouse is n't working properly 
it is working absolutely perfectly 
that state this mouse 
however I am using this 
that have reported issues 
bought this because I also have 
wanted a Bluetooth mouse 
Master is performing flawlessly 
likely purchase another one 
Works great , feels great 
it worked 
used a previous version 
that uses a AA battery 
mouse uses a lithium battery 
solving that problem 
lasts weeks 
normal wheel clicks when you want 
when you flick the wheel to scroll 
that allows you to have 
allows the wheel to free-wheel 
buttons for the thumb were mentioned by some to be useless 
wheel for horizontal scrolling could have a little better acceleration 
use the ability 
n't take unnecessary resources 
Software works reliably 
buy one again if I had 
It has an automatic switch between the ratcheted and `` free spin '' scroll mode , it basically detects when you hit the scroll for long spin -LRB- e. g. , when you want to quickly move down a document -RRB- and automatically switches to the free spin mode , when the scroll stops 
it basically detects 
it moves back 
some getting used to , but once you do 
it 's really missed 
It takes 
also use the MX Performance 
missing the auto switch 
auto-switch is not working 
it used to -LRB- tend 
bought it 
luckily that definition can be changed 
horizontal scroll was designed 
program the mouse 's buttens 
Easy on the grip and it tracks really well 
Replaces my old MX series 
just plug it into the long supplied USB cable & use it as a wired mouse until it 's fully charged 
use it 
husband likes it 
move screens side to side too 
splurge a little 
bought a replacement 
it seems to work 
now I LOVE it 
how I liked the free-wheeling capability 
use the scroll wheel to slow 
it will disengage the ratcheting 
give the wheel a fast spin 
stop it 
use it 
that you can customize to do 
whatever you want 
rest has a little button under it so that if you tap it when someone walks in your office it 'll pause 
horizontal scroll does n't work 
i really do n't know why i waited 
Bluetooth works as it should 
having the dongle 
fits my hand 
charge it using 
it automatically shifts 
use it 
it has some weight 
Dont know 
differentiate the back 
what others are talking about when saying 
Suggest this 
Best mouse I 've ever owned , gone 
loved it 
Had an earlier version 
This seems to be a worthy 
used many types 
Logitech has hit the nail 
What makes this scroll wheel even better 
it has a hybrid mode 
mode allows you to ratchet scroll , however 
Windows snap features 
This allows me to utilize 
It will last 
It works 
software does not come 
It must be downloaded 
press the buttons 
This causes your thumb to be at a weird angle 
highly recommend for productivity first , gaming second 
not recommend this product if you are a hardcore competitive gamer 
Personally , I use it 
gaming I suggest 
that does 
bought this mouse after experiencing 
battery is built in and if it dies you just plug in the cord and keep using it while it charges 
little features work really well 
who tends to rest 
Customization is handled really smoothly by the Options software , too 
owned the Performance MX 
it supported multiple PCs 
This totally checked those boxes while added 
paired this 
it works quickly 
use it 
it 's worked well 
use it while charging 
recommend it 
who wants to do 
that allows the mouse to still be in use 
works great.-The material 
allows a lot 
charging port 
mouse fits my hand 
that accompanies the mouse 
that does not have bluetooth 
mouse is coated in feels 
it does NOT have 
that you press 
use the mouse 
squeeze your thumb 
found this to not be the case 
some say 
button feels vague 
said dongle 
it will collect 
mouse has no storage space 
edge of the thumb button is not attached to the frame to allow 
also because Mac OSX does it better 
purchased 3 more 
house has so many great features 
reviews build it up 
claims it to be comfortable 
This is always gon na be subjective 
That said 
which I will get to 
SOME getting used 
which takes up the more traditional positioning of the back and forward buttons takes 
thumb will take 
little getting used 
button ` feels ' bigger and much more prominent than the forward button , as I find 
it track 
which allows 
puts many decent mouse 
life seems alright 
horizontal scroll wheel on the side will stand out first 
most websites are optimized for vertical scrolling anyway , rendering 
However , in productivity/media software , like hulking excelsheets , over the horizontal thumbnails strip inside a video editing software , or zoomed in tight on an image in photoshop , it WILL come in quite handy 
vertical wheel , positioned more traditionally 
where this mouse ACTUALLY separates 
Everyone 's seen their share 
that let 
free scrolling ' wheels roll unimpeded 
handful will have seen mice 
that are physically impeded 
some will have seen 
it gives you the option 
mouse does that 
putting pressure on the wheel as you spin the normally ` clicky ' wheel , the wheel mechanically switch to a free wheeling mode until you stop 
which will then mechanically switch 
adjust the sensitivity 
it will get the job 
at least you can shift the DPI 
numeric value of DPI you 're switching 
simply changing the cursor speed 
fully customize the gesture keys 
It COULD have done 
this is probably why a lot of tech-savy productivity users are shifting 
put multiple Logitech devices 
CONNECTIVITYThe included ` Unifier ' dongle 
which lets 
when these dongles are phased 
bluetooth seems to work 
it 's got a weightiness 
that matches 
BUILDThe build 
it 's pleasing 
buttons feel solid 
raise a little complaint 
wheel ... , at least mine , rattles 
mouse has n't been dropped 
rattle is inevitable 
that greatly increases my productivity 
that allows 
it comes 
wanted a replacement 
color matches 
iMac and the mouse works PERFECT 
mouse is friggin ' amazing 
it feels great 
who rest their hand on the mouse and grip with the palm of their hand as opposed 
it synced 
it has become the only mouse 
that I want to use 
use this daily for drafting 
Logitech has the option 
what each button does 
thumb , back , and forward button can do pretty much anything 
saving files 
This includes opening specific folders 
that gets 
constant search for the perfect mouse never ends 
develop needs 
When you spend most of your day using 
has some weight 
options via the logitech software only increase 
use it 
then buy another one to replace 
simplifies my work processes by being able 
commonly used commands 
using my Magic Mouse 
tips of my fingers would have a bit 
that also allowed 
using the MX Master 
used logitech 's software 
Just that one little change feels like it saved 
mouse has definitely helped 
increase my productivity 
i bought this 
i wanted 
it looks beautiful 
forward backward buttons on the side make browsing 
not regret this purchase 
what I want it to do 
laptop and a Dynex wired USB mouse 
it works perfectly 
use it as a Bluetooth mouse so I do n't have 
use many other Bluetooth devices , I 've never had any interference issues 
that complain 
n't understand the other reviews 
feature has sped up my workflow considerably 
only charged it 
use it 
battery has yet to run 
it 's still got 2/3 power bars 
got it 
had it for about two months now and only charged it on the day I got it and it 's still got 2/3 power bars ; I use it on average 1 hr a day , though some days I use 
this to say 
that will allow 
who wants a comfortable , functional mouse 
streamline your workflow 
also got the Hermitshell case 
does a great job 
who uses it 
creates a more enjoyable work experience 
It makes my workflow so much easier 
life of the mouse and the way it integrates with your computer beats out any other software 
it integrates 
This works so smooth 
fast wheel unlock makes scrolling 
that tracks 
that lasted 
occasionally play games on it as 
mostly use it 
have no issues 
Best Mouse ever/I use a Macbook Pro 
running 10.8.5 
find this mouse to be a lifesaver 
which saves so much time 
thumb-wheel allows me to scroll 
move clip by clip along the timeline respectively 
also assigned the side buttons 
far I 've had no issues with the ratchet wheel breaking , despite scrolling 
trying the different channels and finally locking on with channel 1 , I 've been turning the mouse 
it maybe took an extra minute longer 
It works perfectly 
have a mac and are on the fence due to prior negative reviews , just give it a shot 
had no problems 
get it to connect 
Use it 
that wo n't quit 
take it everywhere 
Mouse has been driving me insane 
chose the MX Master 
researching reviews 
Still got a brand new mouse 
that works 
bought this because I was having 
It has every feature 
designer or engineer would ever need 
It 's made 
always preferred Logitech mice 
mouse so far , and I have been using their mice 
so as we replace other mice 
right after getting this mouse several 
buying the MX master 
Fits my hand 
it!I liked this mouse so much 
making my first review 
designed mouse 
program shortcuts on it , so that 's a plus 
it does last 
it does last about 3 days 
It has a small piece 
that I use to tie 
feel the same way as 
it docks to become 
take it 
ALWAYS goes 
feels really nice , I rarely use the side buttons 
run linux 
n't had the time 
other OS users probably have 
old MX mouse but the left button was going out 
Liked this so much I bought another one the next week , to use 
bought another one 
using this 
not notice any lag 
charge it seldomly 
it lasts me forever 
getting one 
Probably does lots more that I do n't know 
Gets heavy use 
that make life so much easier 
Great for workstation , it has many features 
mouse changed my life 
it floats 
It fits my hand so well 
that convienently works with my phone too 
it needs a charge 
get about 6-8 nine hour days 
charge it 
use it 
tried gaming 
which I really did like 
sort of configuration of additional features relies 
particularly since the new Magic Mice use proprietary Li-ion batteries 
which I admittedly gave in on anyway since the MX Master is the same 
tried a Razer Orochi 
that I use 
Logitech does it 
Magic Mouse -LRB- and the pleasant Microsoft Explore Touch mouse that I use at work -RRB- do inertial scrolling 
sensitivity set very high 
it does 
Mine has n't failed yet , if/when 
inertial scroll on this thing will go 
spun it 
watched page after page load after having quickly scrolled 
have no connectivity issues 
thumbwheel on the MX Master , while not as magical as the vertical scroll wheel , works very well 
that seems occasionally unstable 
All of this -LRB- as well as sensitivity , scroll wheel mode , etc. -RRB- is handled 
n't hold my breath 
Hopefully they get it to a better place as time goes 
where the thumb rests 
angle triggers them best 
which of the two you 're about to trigger , not immediately obvious what angle triggers them best , takes a bit of dexterity to hit 
that 's 
scheme does n't match anything else 
n't find this to be a problem 
briefly had definitely handled that 
using this mouse 
get most things 
which in some strange way this mouse just seems to compliment 
mouse does 
exactly what I wanted it to do 
it does it well 
have two different computers 
extra mouse took up more space 
Master immediately solved that problem 
it also has plenty of buttons for me to use 
assign different buttons to perform 
which allows me to move 
ever had !! 
Excellent build quality 
loving it 
software needs a bit 
mouse really helps since it allows 
having joint pain 
had it 
ordered a second unified receiver to ensure 
that allows 
Previously , I used a Razer mouse with a USB splitter/switch to toggle 
feature is built 
fact that this feature is built into the mouse lets 
Razer lasted 
ordered this mouse to replace 
mouse is supposed 
That said 
Razer allows a high level 
getting the MX Master to respond 
liked the Mamba to be set 
had no problem 
Mamba has 
charge the thing 
i got was broken 
sent me a replacement right away 
exactly what I expected 
purchased it primarily for it 's channel capabilities 
it connects 
take the $ 20 discount 
product refurbished 
mouse was used before it got 
far I have noticed no flaws 
Everything seems to be working 
had the Preformance Mouse MX 
use those buttons a lot because I program 
n't mind the smaller buttons 
use the heck 
It feels lighter 
which I had used for years before I bought 
button can be configured to take 
connection works as advertised 
people have complained about how easy it is 
accidentally move the thumb wheel 
personally configured it as 
used to it , it actually feels quite convenient 
easily it moves 
wheel was ratcheting 
use it daily 
it would fit my small hands 
wear women 's small or children 's large glove 
found no problem 
requires minimal force to move 
feel of the right/left click buttons 
it feels very good 
have some trouble 
charged around one month , I 'm using it 
n't have anything 
had the smaller versions 
which had double click problems 
This works 
go dead , you can use it by plug it into the USB on your computer while it charges 
never shut it 
Charge lasts 
got this 
wheel wo n't let 
automatic free wheel spinning has spoiled 
life is vastly improved 
It feels solid 
it works great 
highly recommend this mouse 
it has a lot 
up quickly -LRB- I usually just put it on the charger when it because low 
It holds 
n't really use all 
's no notification when the mouse is low 
give it 
Best mouse i have ever used 
awesome , you can suck it magic mouse 
Logitech hit a home run 
loves it 
so he can take it 
bought a case 
gotten many compliments 
it can be connected 
mice is working great 
previous mice M510 stopped working when I performed 
Charge lasts about two weeks 
it has a reasonable amount 
Mouse just feels 
also use a Logitech MX Performance Wireless Mouse 
n't used this 
had a MX Anywhere v1 before 
What they did with the scroll wheel on this on is amazing 
so you can have any mouse button control 
Also , on click it will free wheel if you give 
blue tooth it is connected to based 
only thing I wish , is you could control 
precision is much improved 
use it 
running this 
MX fits my giant mitts as if it was molded 
have huge hands 
n't found a lot of uses for the side thumb wheel yet 
use it 
it serves 
n't require a lot of force to activate 
switch it 
It 's got good weight 
that designed this mouse 
team at Logitech that designed this mouse should feel incredibly proud 
set the button 
where you rest your thumb 
cord does n't obstruct when plugged 
which works on glass surface efficiently 
has bunch 
Fits my hands perfectly 
n't install program 
features on my Mac are actually mind boggling 
using various types 
It works 
It has a fast response 
It has also helped 
reduce the pain 
It also recharges 
It also comes 
mouse helps 
have 3 different computers 
keyboard and the Logitech MX Master Wireless Mouse do the trick 
mouse makes the switch 
keyboard switches between the machines successfully 90 % 
now still using it 
used the performance MX 
gave it 5 stars because it is simply the best mouse 
however have some comments 
that it can automatically disengage 
basically the rattle on/off is now electronically controlled 
it sometime does 2 lines 
which adds the future 
Which they had the button accessible on the top though for fast switching ... Overall 
using one 
Finally , a mouse meets its master 
Fits my hand like it was made 
mouse everywhere where I work 
it works great 
got this mouse 
Fits my hand very well 
mouse has a great melding 
It works great 
hand comfortably rests 
use a computer 
This has made a huge difference 
never spent more than $ 20 on a mouse before 
had a lot 
n't regret it 
spin the wheel all the time just to feel 
that 's just because I have n't grown 
had the thing for two days now 
had it for several months now 
it all programmed to do 
it works amazingly 
wanted it 
It took me a bit to get 
ditched the mouse pad 
Strongly recommend !!! 
also appreciate the larger-than-normal size 
use it 
never have any comfort problems 
especially when you can find it 
recommend it 
It works 
charging cable 
where the retarded Apple Magic Mouse 2 I was using has a charging port on the _ bottom _ of the mouse , rendering 
Logitech also includes a USB RF dongle 
device with which you 're using the mouse does n't have native bluetooth support 
using the mouse 
that lies directly 
thumb-rest area has an almost hidden button 
subtle , yet satisfying click 
just apply a little downward pressure 
smallish buttons nestled behind the scroller take 
Overall , I give this mouse a `` 10/10 
using it 
charged it twice 
that you can set 
use it 
often take it home when I need 
It connects 
It works fine for selecting sheets in an Excel workbook , though 
profile for your work computer , your tablet , and your home PC can be selected 
included software makes configuring 
really like how the mouse can save up to 3 devices 
that finally died 
replaced my old MX Mouse 
it had 
only charged it 
Sadly , that was released prior to Logitech 's decision to release subsequent mice with their Unifying receiver , so the dongle was rather sizeable 
release subsequent mice 
replaced it with an MX Anywhere since I 'd switched 
used the heck 
it took many 
went on sale , I snagged one 
some getting used 
MX1100 had a user-switchable scroll wheel , so the dynamic wheel on this takes 
reports indicate 
built-in battery lasts 
using this 
it feels 
that I have every used 
that ... but this has to be the best mouse 
just wishing my Trackball M570 
looking for the best , it stops right here 
mouse made my life 
large hands and this mouse fits me perfectly 
use it 
it costs 
have a similar version 
taking it 
bought this version 
buttons and wheel feel durable 
it asked me to remove 
it synced 
turned the mouse 
Now I have two keyboards 
one struck a good balance 
tried many ergonomic mice 
that I can use to configure 
who wants an easy 
targeted for the power user , this mouse would satisfy anyone 
use and comfortable mouse 
it looks much better 
used both Logitech MX Performance 
It has Bluetooth 
who do n't want to sacrifice 
Also , I have three computers 
certainly recommend this 
who needs more 
using it

This allows the user to switch

it deserved the 5-star anyway 
do any work 
Originally I bought a Logitech M320 to use 
n't sit hear 
have anything 
laptop plugged 
eyeing the MX Master 
sculpting it 
fondling it 
It fits my hand 
it can come in pretty handy 
n't find the gesture button , as they call 
it deploys Mission Control to help 
that works just fine 
that 'll do pretty much anything 
do yourself the favor 
hopefully it 'll work just as well 
that works 
n't need a left-handed mouse 
's a ton of customizability , if you 're into that kinda thing 
recommend this mouse 
Obviously serious gamers can probably look elsewhere 
Mouse moves smooth 
It took about 3 weeks of use before the mouse complained 
It comes out of sleep very quickly 
it fits the hand perfectly 
it took no time 
what the Mac Mouse SHOULD be 
that have one piece 
it looks nice 
miss it on all other mice now 
nice , it 's not as incredibly satisfying 
G900 has a mechanical button 
switch modes 
when it starts blinking 
it needs to be charged 
not impede your work.-excellent bluetooth 
use it 
it wakes right up 
leave it 
had some input lag issues

bought this to replace 
purchased this model of mouse over 
recommend it 
when it wakes up , but otherwise tracks well , using 
wireless devices don 
t require dongles 
that use up precious USB ports 
it would be annoying 
that has limited USB ports 
one is attached to a desktop unit so it 's not much 
that wo n't let 
use it 
It totally changed my laptop 
that gave good service 
spots rubbed 
old one has

this will do so

that work 
which makes it quite convenient 
that needs to be plugged

replace the batteries just once 
It works great 
size fits nicely 
trusty old wireless mouse for my laptop has been acting increasingly flaky lately

it did no good 
thing has been used 
get a new one

it feels rock-solid without being heavy 
It fits much more comfortably 
setting up the mouse 
putting it into operation very simple 
took the mouse 
opened the battery compartment 
took out the nano radio receiver 
put the tiny radio receiver 
Then I closed the battery compartment 
mouse started working 
wheel turns easily 
buttons click softly without being mushy 
It points 
that I can use to navigate web pages when I 'm online 
The also work very well , although I think 
that I downloaded 
time will tell

that earns my highest recommendation

Get your old school productivity back 
defined left and right clicks 
have a sneaking suspicion a classic mouse would be better than a track pad , or a magic mouse , that does n't give you defined left and right clicks , follow that instinct 
that does n't give 
mouse will get you back 
also recommend a large rubber mat/mouse pad 
that goes 
it , for OSX users , check out the uBar app 
which will give you a windows style bottom task bar 
have semi-large hands so it is great 
Had a good reaction time 
already have a mouse

bottons works to it full word 
mouse works well easy to handle

bought this 
Clicking sound 
Original mouse died -LRB- although I have fixed 
soon have a new MacBook Pro so nice 
Do the job 
buy !! 
it lasts literally forever 
new apple mouse -LRB- this version -RRB- charges 
using it everyday 
which is already an A + so cant complain 
that works seamlessly 
have a mouse 
Apple does it right 
it will last 
taken the mouse 
replacement much improved 
it charges super 
recommended , the battery lasts a lot 
Great seller , item delivered as described , very much appreciate 
put my computer 
It is certainly well behaved 
Looks good , I have no issue 
what to expect 
amazing it can do 
charge seem to last 
that shock 
mouse can be use the same way 
It comes 
used a standard Apple Lightning cable to recharge 
one has a self-contained rechargeable battery 
Personally , I find this superior 
that bugged 
First , the battery cover on the original version tends to be somewhat loose 
which needed frequent recharging 
Second , the built-in battery seems to last 
charge this 
thus have it 
Finally , the fact that you can charge this with a Lightning cable means 
it 's because you 're using 
find that easier 
CA N'T use the mouse while it recharges , as the cable input is on the bottom 
this does the trick 
needed a new mouse 
having the omnidirectional scrolling 
Look great and having the omnidirectional scrolling is a must 
Exactly what was described 
What can I say ??? 
LOVE MY MOUSE !!!! Awesome design 
who can not get used 
charging time 
instruction on Youtube only mentioned 2 minute charging time although it took 
what do you expect 
Some have complained 
easy recommend this item 
it costs a bit more 
what you pay for 
Scrolling works great 
replace old Magic Mouse 
It came 
it still has a 20 % charge 
buy this again 
It woths every penny 
bought it 
mouse has all the `` cool factor 
It takes a bit 
that all my other Apple devices use 
it uses the same fire wire charger 
how an innate object can be considered sexy 
had a bit 
that I received 
who sent me a replacement cord immediately 
it works great 
received my cord promptly 
Why pay full price !! 
definitely take time for you to get used 
never had a problem 
all of us use a mouse 
still do all the finger gestures on the top of the Magic Mouse when you are holding 
it works flawlessly 
It had not run down 
lasted one 1/2 month 
People keep mocking 
it does n't really matter since the battery can last 
getting use 
surpasses any other 
use Windows PC so had 
mouse would not work 10inches away 
Battery lasts forever 
What can I say 
it works well 
Ca n't go wrong 
get weeks of use before needing 
lot of people say 
it glides 
Good product worked fine 
protects my baby amazingly well 
it fits very well 
even put usb adapter 
Just get this 
using the touch surface 
software on apple could do 
had the older version 
use it 
not had any problems yet 
It moves much smoother 
works !! 
great mouse , nice you do n't have to change 
Charge lasts 1-2 months 
Apple adds right-click capability 
That being said , the mouse charges 
Buying batteries 
never had a low battery message 
charge my mouse 
never had issues 
just plug it into my computer overnight 
plastic on the bottom feels a little more `` slick 
Other than that , it just feels 
buying batteries 
Never in all my years in the end-user role have I had a mouse as seamless as this one - absolutely a pleasure 
anything I wish could change 
have use 
Knocked one 
Banged another 
it works great 
What can you say 
Takes a little practice 
quick install 
uses it frequently 
it helps her work 
excellent product from Apple , operates much better 
n't require the use 
it works 
it even has more functions 
charge the mouse 
that you can do 
many batteries I 've gone through 
that I kept buying 
who received it 
person who received it liked it 
Received it promptly 
battery powered mouse successfully 
first Apple mouse became erratic 
mouse went 
new Apple Magic Mouse 2 gets a 2 hr 
really have n't drained the internal batteries down yet 
it needs charging 
charge every 2 months , well I think 
n't need batteries 
Apple will figure 
how to design it so that you can use 
how it glides easier 
Who knew 
that pair nicely 
just LOVE our new mouse 
replacing batteries 
A must have 
who ca n't trust the pad to erase 
i go 
So we returned it 
always replacing batteries 
saving money not having 
that I function quite well 
handle my laptop 
using this mouse now 
mouse works great 
that I use 
it works 
that are recharged using 
using this mouse 
it goes to `` sleep 
Item came as described 
Charge lasts a very long time 
takes several months 
replaceable batteries means 
save a decent chunk 
using the mouse 
hate subscription fees 
Disconnecting a device 
IPhone and it connects to the hardwired device regardless 
just plug it directly 
feeling the design team 
feedback included the poor placement 
Apple likes their stuff to be aesthetically pleasing 
It literally makes the mouse unusable while charging 
charging is a relatively quick process 
mouse despite the odd placement of it 's charging port

Exactly what I was expecting 
Mouse works perfectly 
Warehouse highly recommend 
what it says 
gauge the battery strength 
n't find a way 
new mouse does n't enforce that 
remembered to charge the mouse every night , this problem would n't have occurred 
product works perfectly 
that was known 
build a PC 
charging port on the bottom does n't bother 
It has only one button 
it can tell which side 
set the option 
Just go into system preferences then mouse 
It slides smoothly 
it looks exactly the same 
just got the Apple Magic Mouse 
it had batteries 
NOT use it while it 's charging 
buy the Magic Mouse 
it works great 
running it 
used product 
what I can say 
have three 
actually use it 
Uses bluetooth 
Has good battery 
It came sealed 
using this mouse , nothing else compares 
just turn off old mouse 
turn this new one 
new mouse really works good and no installation 
which beats replacing 
bought the mouse 
n't changed the mouse one time 
use it 
n't turn it 
seriously considering the rechargeable keyboard now 
have 2 
latest generation of keyboard and mouse both come 
charge w 
that is included

Mouse 2 has no flaws 
just charge it !! 
keeping batteries around 
recommend it 
first Apple mouse and I have to say 
what it 's called 
bought this Magic Mouse earlier 
Just plug charge 
definitely recommend this mouse to anyone because it is wireless 
it has a great feel 
Great product , came 
It has a lot more functions 
top surface works same 
detects each finger 
Click surface 
say its an apple mouse 
This became a non-issue 
Great buy !! 
that has proven difficult 
it has the name 
comment needed 
Works great & looks great , too 
wife tired of her Apple tracking pad so we bought 
wife never got entirely comfortable 
that works as described 
use the mouse 
photographer I edit a lot 
Perviously before owning a Mac 
hand would suffer gravely from right clicking 
made the switch 
how to use a regular mouse 
Granted the price 
package came right 
recommend this product 
granddaughter loves this mouse 
friend of mine uses one 
use the touch pad 
do everything 
Moving your finger 
drag one handed 
batteries needed 
It will charge from your computer using 
good product , i recommend !!!! 
Was brand new 
This worked out great 
recharge it 
makes life much easier , the gestures on it allow you to work 
batteries died frequently 
connection interrupts 
pad on an older Mac Air finally gave 
Magic Mouse serves 
Having the surface 
this you 'll also want to take 
connection works great 
have it paired 
it had around 21 % battery 
functions work 
MBP works fine 
had 3 
activate the 2nd button 
makes no sense 
Apple never fails 
GO GO Apple 
finding the thin metal 
swapping batteries 
Sadly for Apple , it 's 
what they should have released 
that you become addicted 
Came in its original packaging and everything was included 
Have had it 
say more?Okay 
i have ever used 
It works great 
palm feels a bit tired 
Now I can handle it so well 
few worst reviews say 
given a try 
gesture could n't work 
tried it with my new mac pro with the old Maverick OS when I received 
upgraded to El Captain , it works perfectly 
what can be seen when close 
mouse came with original box without lighting 
still have a shining finish 
gesture may misled even when your fingers have lightly swift 
how it charges etc. 
have the original Magic Mouse as 
seen a lot 
n't use the mouse while it 's charging 
that does n't have a built in trackpad I can see 
have an iMac 
have enough juice 
probably deserved a break anyhow 
never use batteries on my IMac Mouse again 
others had said 
connect works great 
always use a Magic Mouse 
once Apple released 
Got exactly what I ordered 
still have a 60 % + charge 
had it 
scrolling can be done 
then doing the multi finger gestures 
only sort of gripe would be 
do the gesture 
spent some time at the Apple store testing 
hand and arm got tired 
couple of gestures seemed to 
that separated this mouse 
Good Conditions !! 
It works 
Everything works well 
Exactly what I need 
Works great , the Apple MM # 2 replaced the older model 
that used 2 AA batteries 
battery holds a charge 
Only have it 
Works perfectly , arrived quickly , item 
batteries stocked up 
that could be made 
feel standpoint 
bought one 
bought two 
another bought one on Amazon to replace 
liked it so much 
still am one 
who likes the control 
mouse comes 
well hitting a hard floor 
damaged a couple of the older design by denting 
which impacted the clicking motion 
pose a problem 
seriously ... the thing will get a 9 hours worth 
People complain because the charging port is on the bottom 
Takes a bit to get used to if you 've never used 
how it handles 
Apple delivers world class products 
that would work amazing 
wanted something 
getting it to be recognized 
it dies 
it charges real quick 
Hubby loves it 
that I paid 
noticed some negative reviews 
that did concern me a little 
how anyone would consider that a problem 
single charge lasts an incredibly long time 
it 's only 
that wo n't interfere with my work , because I 'm not on the computer 24 X 
plug it in when I get 
mouse has quickly become an extension 
help sinks ng 
bought this because I go 
first apple magic mouse 2 would randomly not connect 
that has worked perfectly 
got a replacement 
sent it 
replace it 
issue with your mouse send it back 
only need a short time 
Saves me money 
Moreover , because battery is integrated the mouse no longer has battery placement issues 
dislodged in the first version in I would constantly lose power 
battery always got 
version fixed that issue 
that is used 
recharge you same type 
charge it by just plugging 
which was always running 
which gave me problems 
cause the browser to navigate 
This only happens occasionally 
that I have experienced while using 
it 's probably saved me an hour of time since I received 
exposè '' the windows 
it feels so solid 
other users have mentioned 
charging it 
it really does n't affect my use of the mouse , as charging it for 5 mins is enough 
mobility and access of an actual computer mouse , for me , has a natural advantage 
Takes a little to get used 
do a lot 
It works 
charge it 
this works 
it !!!! So far its worked wonders 
Mouse keeps a good condition 
far it has n't needed a charge 
it still had 60 percent left 
great improvement from the original mouse apple had seven years ago 
upgraded to the Mouse 2 and my problems with screen jitter on Mouse 1 have gone away 
recharging is no problem 
Having a permanent battery 
made a slimmer design 
Ca n't go wrong 
mouse works great 
recharge it using 
using batteries 
charge is done quickly 
had a Magic Mouse 
that constantly lost connectivity 
This works fast 
Charges fast , lasts 
Easy to set up , works flawlessly 
much prefer its touch surface 
why I bought this second version 
first Magic Mouse went through batteries rather quickly 
wanted the rechargeable battery 
charge has held well so far 
Which brings 
what could be argued to be a minor design flaw 
charging the mouse 
's no room 
port on either side would have spoiled its feel 
Besides , OS X notifies you when the power is running low , so it 's easy 
wireless mouses ... this one works great 
computer recognizes it immediately 
Community that purchased this item gave me quick response 
that purchased this item 
answered all 
had my doubts about the authenticity of this product-as a few reviewers claimed 
n't fault it for costs , however , as you are making 
products should give you a long life 
something does go wrong 
which I bought 5 years ago 
paid 30 bucks 
got a decent life 
mouse should last even longer 
Apple made the Magic Mouse 
motion controls 
own an iMac , you 're already using the Apple Magic Mouse 
give it a tablet-like functionality 
Which I Like Alot Also When you flip the Magic Mouse 
see two 3-inch , black , hard plastic strips 
that run 
pad required Overall 
mouse glide 
gestures work 
Easy paring , all gestures work , simplistic design 
have no problem 
reviewers complained 
battery lasts a long time 
just charge it when I 'm not using 
it 's very well made 
it just works 
Awesome mouse , spent the extra mine 
also has the ability 
charge it instead of using 
It works fantastic 
It 's been going 
it started working 
it was n't working 
having problems 
order this 
It has made all the difference 
it uses a battery 
recharge it 
Apple did a great job 
recharge the mouse 
easily see the amount of charge in the mouse or Apple Keyboard by simply clicking 
Easy set 
lasted the battery 
have large hands it will take some time to get use to holding the mouse because it is small 
use the track pad on my MacBook less 
work fine 
just bought this one because my old mouse died 
Everything was just as promised 
simple mouse , lots of functionality and configurations can be done 
it gets 
it feels like it 's gon 
use the Magic Mouse 
picked up a used Magic Mouse here 
Just plug it in 
it 's connected 
wireless mouse did n't work well 
mouse feels perfect in my hand and tracks without skipping 
have a love-hate relationship 
However , after just a couple weeks I do n't do that quite as much 
initially gave this a 4 star review 
easy to learn , I bumped it back up 
still prefer this mouse 
doing a ton 
However , for just the random , infrequent interaction I prefer the trackpad 
just what I needed !! 
using it as we speak 
loves it 
This works great 
It navigates well 
it connects quickly 
Making it so you can not use 
it charges quickly 
it holds a charge 
it , especially with no batteries !! 
Mouse wo n't work 
Performed a. s expected 
absolutely loves it 
So I have no complaints 
still has not charged it 
placed the lightning port on the side so that you could use 
functionality works flawlessly 
makes switching 
that definitely saw some stagnation with regards 
It 's going to be hard 
mouse form the picture altogether 
gestures work as 
inventing a way 
mouse has a quick charge feature 
mouse will have enough battery life 
charging time 
get a glass 
then it takes to get 
see your current battery life in OS X , click the bluetooth symbol 
select your Mouse , and the current battery strength percentage will be displayed 
much rather have the rechargeable battery 
tracking on a variety of surfaces works excellent 
it glides smoothly 
currently use my mouse 
It also works nicely 
provides good feedback 
have the touch surface 
mouse comes 
mouse comes 
started manual 
charging cord 
questions feel free 
Never had a problem 
Did notice 
model `` glided '' a bit better 
feeling generous tonight 
deducting 1/2 star 
give this 4.5 stars 
charge it 
that used AA batteries 
Charging is effective 
Solve the problem 
using a Lighting cable 
get it 
provided sufficient leverage for me to pull 
It accepts gestures 
hand awkwardly positioned 
it should prove durable 
running El Capitan 
so check your OS before ordering 
have at least Yosemite -LRB- 10.10 -RRB- to use 
Plug the thunderbolt cable 
lower left hand corner 
> Mouse will tell you the degree 
Frankly I wish my mouse 
still has 58 % charge 
it takes approx 20 mIns 
tried it on 
Using it 
this does n't work properly 
having a mouse/trackpad combo 
What else can you say 
had some trouble 
it worked immediately 
getting it 
once I downloaded the newer program 
recommend it 
seeking a cordless mouse 
Easy to use 
Package came 
It took a little while to get 
used the original magic mouse prior 
it paired quickly 
Finally say good bye 
replacing batteries 
It holds a charge longer 
it takes me to brew 
had it 
perhaps made a slight sacrifice to aesthetics by placing 
one could use it while its charging 
At least it charges quickly 
n't need batteries 
made life so much easier while working 
Mine works great 
who your mouse is being sold by before making 
seen quite a few reviews 
it still has 
had mine 
never charged it 
percent left 
Great mouse works well 
Trackpad takes far too much effort 
use the trackpad 
doing that 
Magic Mouse solved several problems 
then the magic begins 
read reviews 
proper OS installed 
n't had any issues so I can honestly recommend 
this helps 
it is supposed 
it !! 
What can I say 
had the original Magic Mouse 
MM2 just feels a little smoother 
It works essentially the same 
it has n't bothered 
battery die 
already have a lightning USB cable on my desk so it 's not a big deal 
Also , the Magic Mouse 2 uses the Bluetooth 4 standard 
it feels more responsive 
one works flawlessly 
original apple mouse died 
had it 
move the charging port to the front so you could use 
tell apple 
it replaced 
that it recharges 
using batteries 
genius at Apple took the perfect mouse 
it has a rechargeable battery 
that uses a lightning connector to charge 
one comes 
cool because if you have another device like an iPhone or iPad , you have these cords already 
hate ... hate 
that take hours to recharge 
that do n't hold a charge 
team will balance 
that will satisfy those 
mouse looks and feels the same 
form and function build 
it FINALLY has reached 8 % charge 
bought the mouse 
get it 
it looks 
ultra cool with the Apple logo lit 
user and I just got a MacBook Pro retina 
who feels 
trackpad , no matter how technologically advance , will ever replace the feel 
mouse has to offer 
read two button mouse 
Furthermore , I have never used a Mac OS before let 
Apple would come up with a better name than `` Magic 
ordered the latest and greatest Magic Mouse 
have good size hands 
read the reviews 
it does n't take long 
Anyways , I also read a lot 
which should last 
get a full charge 
charge it when you go 
let the mouse charge 
Adding a charging port 
it look un-Apple like 
using my big hand 
one closes 
mouse itself should be gripped with just your thumb and fourth finger -LRB- the one closes to your pinky -RRB- leaving 
palming the entire mouse than you 're gon 
that are easily enabled 
good and the sleek design goes well 
Overall it looks 
use it 
buy it again 
LOVE this new mouse 
It instantly syncs 
What can I say 
replaced my old circa 2007 sooner 
liked the previous Apple Magic Mouse 
it died 
used it 
it felt 
It retains all the control 
it feels like it effortlessly glides 
scrolling and multitasking functions 
mention something 
nobody seems to be mentioning 
had this for exactly one month now 
use it 
never seeing a charger 
used one 
Unfortunately , I could NEVER get rechargeable AA batteries 
tried NiMH 
which I recycled 
FINALLY I have a Magic Mouse 
bought this because I misplaced 
really liked it 
it work at first 
it worked flawlessly 
Charges FAST !! 
Charge lasts a long time 
month anymore just charge the rechargeable battery

Apple sneaked 
Steve will roil-over 
Got an iMac

Now I can finally retire the Logitech mouse 
expeditious delivery and this technology has improved greatly

Good quality and it even matches the color 
Replaced my daughter 's mouse 
that stopped working 
looove it , perfect 
It 's exactly 
it would be 
what I hoped 
use it 
n't had any problems yet 
Software used to bug out 
mouse has such a smoother feel 
it was replacing 
software does have a high learning curve 
made a World 
create profiles 
that become active 
that would only become active when World of Warcraft was running 
whatever you set 
now when I launch the game , the mouse shifts 
once the game is closed the mouse returns 
what they were set 
set buttons 
lowers the DPI while held 
mouse feels 
update this review 
LOVE THIS MOUSE 
then required use 
that can be programmed to make 
had my Logitech G700 
loved that mouse 
it really does helps 
plug it 
remap the mouse keys 
get the software 
it 's just figuring 
how to get the keys 
button broke withing 
got a replacement very fast 
engine needs some work though 
many times I have saved actions into my library only to find 
change each mecro 
son loved it 
it execpt 
i play a lot of FPS/MOBA games so the additional buttons are awesome 
hurl it 
looses their minds 
up just in case I have a rage session 
it took a little getting used 
it initially did 
using it 
What really sold 
Great for MMO 's , I had been using the mouse 
used 6 of the side buttons to map 
program all of the keys to different functions , it 
that let 
have a RGB Corsair product 
used this mouse 
have small hands this mouse will take a lot 
reading all the reviews , It holds up 
setting up all the keybinds 
Looked at reviews , then did some research 
buttons feel 
Also I dig the customization available 
only use all the side buttons 
it 's actually really really aesthetically pleasing 
rgb led 
gotten a ton of compliments on how this mouse looks 
never write reviews 
mostly use it 
online helped 
It took 
some figuring 
have a color 
thumb LED 
n't hide the fact 
set 12 macros 
just got this mouse 
wife has had 
that I had 
used the scroll wheel 
click almost as much 
it did n't register the clicks anymore 
use it 
needed the center button to work 
wife and I started playing 
Gkeys on the mouse made this the only choice 
has a hard time 
this alleviates that issue 
soft touch rubber coating makes the mouse grip 
puts your thumb in the perfect spot to use 
However , this one seems to work 
It crashes 
customization won me over so fast 
mouse feels great overall 
when you buy this mouse 
Still giving 5 stars as it does feel 
lot to like about this mouse.-It has a good sensor 
making small movement 
where it would think 
grip-Buttons provide good tactile feedback-Scroll wheel 
adjust the thumb buttons forward 
had no problems 
capabilityCons-Would have 
buttons had less resistance 
Missing features 
This makes 
menus hard to read 
ta say 
It 's taking some time 
it runs so smooth 
purchased this mouse 
it works extremely well 
that comes down 
adjust the positions 
really like that you have the ability 
what I wanted the mouse to do 
how to get it to do 
that go in depth on how to use 
n't find a whole lot 
switches which can go from very low mouse movement , to how could people even use this high 
which can go 
it can be used 
son uses 
loves it 
own the Corsair K95 keyboard Corsair Gaming K95 RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard 
this seemed 
far this seems like it fits 
It feels very well 
sort of the current rage , do look fantastic 
Corsair made a keypad similar 
lately Corsair has won me over 
used different gaming mice 
Does the job 
Using the mouse 
which I grown so accustomed 
i did n't get the k65 pro 
it arrived 
where my thumb would go 
Then it arrived 
plugged it 
pick the mouse up one handed fine without accidentally pressing 
press any button 
buttons are perfectly sized 
It fits my large bony hands perfectly 
buttons make 
comfortable mouse i have ever used 
Even if you do n't play MMO 's the buttons 
lighting looks great as 
find uses 
what use 
had very little issues 
it takes very little applies pressure to activate 
others know to be ready 
it paired 
Absolutely looove my mouse 
Switched from my old Razer Naga Molten to a Razer Naga Chroma and it just did n't fit right 
it helped me out a ton 
Scimitar however has the ability 
slide the macro keys 
it feels 
returned my Naga Chroma 
adding texture 
Scimitar has this nice grip 
Corsair continue making 
just received this mouse a couple days ago after needing 
M90 's ended up getting trashed 
second of which had its axle completely sheared 
play WoW instead of FPS games , the Scimitar seemed my only viable option 
Scimitar gave me more 
wheel seems much more robust 
mouse feels quite comfortable 
buttons slid toward the back of the mouse so there 's 
thumb to rest in 
way , when I lift the mouse up to reposition it on my mousepad , I do n't randomly press any 
hefty metal hex wrench is included so that you can slide 
that behaves similarly 
which YOU will actually never see since you 're using 
zones include the `` sailboat '' logo 
buttons are all illuminated 
computer spent 
never found anything 
What made matters worse 
n't even have rudimentary mouse functionality 
pointer was frozen 
Eventually , the CUE software recognized the mouse 
have a Corsair K70 RGB keyboard so CUE was already up 
mouse going 
that ships with the mouse is misleading because it tells 
install CUE 
functionality beyond the basics is handled 
Setting up the mouse lighting 
each of the four RGB LED zones to have 
that is used to identify 
that color bar 
keep it from being glaring 
setting is changed 
program a button 
using an Intellimouse Explorer 
that has stayed with me ever 
did it 
then either could not do it 
losing button functionality 
it updated the mouse 's firmware 
running the most current version 
once CUE recognized the mouse 
Most of the problems seen seem to happen 
it works great on Fps games like Counter Strike to MMO games like Arms 3 if you are looking 
price hold 
only problem I have with this mouse , is that the side buttons do n't work 
Tilt wheel 
Has no L/R 
Wheel is only for scrolling 
put it 
had no issues with this mouse even after the firmware update 
hurt the wrists 
get it to even recognize 
RGB Strafe 
i own 
Sliding Macro keys 
point of caution for users with KVM switches on their rigs though - these mice do n't seem 
expecting advanced functions 
build quality 
one has the best 
when it works 
ware update 
own two 
it has performed flawlessly 
using it all day at work for 3 months now 
software makes setup easily customizeable 
Logitech Set 
what i was looking

Item was returned 
Mouse was received 
grandson was thrilled 
pair my trackball mouse 
dongle made this possible 
do a lot 
hands still feel ok 
where my laptop keyboard causes my joints in my hands to be very sore 
when typing this , I notice the cushion 
which seem to be the reason 
keys provide 
keyboard , the number pad on the side makes this keyboard fully functional 
got a second 
replace a larger keyboard 
bought this one

full keyboard being long just fit between the arms of my recliner so I had 
bit smaller keyboard allows me to adjust 
bought this much sooner 
Ordered this online after buying 
once I got it 
which I did not expect 
definitely buy it again 
Exactly what I needed

that 's 
what I was looking 
It takes up very little space 
that does n't take up so much room 
keyboard was made 
Well thought out multimedia keys 
Everything is well sized 
who tend to spend 
This paired 
use it 
it works fine

Mine ca n't be turned 
little nubs on the F and J keys are worn 
ordering a new one 
have a habit 
so my keyboard is holding 2.5 years worth 
it paired 
Using one 
Nice touch and feel , does n't feel cheap 
share the same dongle 
who looks at ratings to make 
keys are well spaced 
how the whole thing shines 
keys are so brightly labeled 
Logitech has been making good quality keyboards 
Just what I needed 
likes the shine 
It never fails 
break out the wired one again 
then I have no choice 
it died 
use rechargeable AAA batteries 
had other keyboards 
keeps the keyboard 
certainly recommend it 
It feels super sturdy and firm while typing

Keyboard itself feels good 
Great product works well 
it lasted 
old Logitech broke 
watch TV off 
needed a new keyboard 
light , it feels solid 
never use those -LRB- me -RRB- anyway 
prop the keyboard 
it sounds 
did a lot 
standard batteries will last up 
battery would drain quickly 
that would increase the cost 
it would light 
use this 
office supplied 
some getting used to as the keys are not as high 
crumbs fall 
Using it right now 
It also paired with my 5 year old mouse USB-dongle - so I only needed 
have two 
have large hands 
connect other Logitech devices 
It really helps in freeing 
grand daughter tried using 
paint is worn off the most used keys 
tried out this one 
keyboard offers a good layout 
whenever you turn on your computer 
still having a number keypad 
even has an On-Off switch 
save a bit 
then it connects quickly 
keys laid 
prevent a sleeping computer from waking 
details matter 
keys are very lightly textured 
play/pause & track skipping keys may not work some audio programs 
volume/mute keys work fine 
skipping keys 
using Windows 
need extra and/or expensive features like backlit keys , then this keyboard should serve you nicely 
receiver picks up your keystroke

spacing took 
have a nice tactile feel 
Saves desk space 
has just enough shortcut keys 
that you 'll never use 
has all 
It set up immediately 
use my keyboard to work 
Love it and it even came 
that I 've found 
purchased 3 
used it 
purchasing multiples 
two of them have logged dozens of plane rides in my computer bag , getting shoved 
laptops hate my typing style 
that I 'm writing 
cursor seems to jump 
keyboard solved all of those issues by getting 
it would be if I had 
put my laptop 
Going wireless 
It works well 
best come 
use these 
pair up to six unifying devices 
not plan on pairing this keyboard 
not pair multiple computers with unifying receivers to one keyboard if they are all in the same room 
lolI found this 
give myself some extra desk space by elevating 
have three laptops 
sometimes I take one 
thereby putting the keyboard 
bought a nice wireless mouse and the k360 keyboard to try 
grabbed my other laptop 
downloaded setpoint 
opened my bag to grab 
get some work 
Problem occurred a few days later when laptop number two was still on , sitting on my desk , and I opened my bag to grab my little 13 incher and get some work done on the couch and the damn keyboard didnt work ... days and days later and I finally figured it out , so the issue isnt that you ca n't pair the keyboard or mouse to multiple computers , you absolutely can 
finally figured it 
n't pair the keyboard 
that will work fine 
one at work , and just transport the keyboard and mouse , that will work fine , get to work 
just transport the keyboard 
it will just work 
have one receiver 
turn on the keyboard 
Go home , same thing 
thats it 
just ca n't pair the keyboard 
once the keyboard locks 
worked fine again 
paired it 
Hope that long winded explanation helps somebody 
who ended up in my situation thinking 
that long winded explanation 
had a broken or defective item 
it met my expectations 
keyboard stands easily 
chose this keyboard because I liked 
it 's exactly as pictured 
gloss is beautiful 
quick wipe 
keys also make a really satisfying sound while I type 
highly recommend this one 
Recommend it 
This has a good weight 
exactly what I wanted as I purchased 
It feels very similar 
used the keyboard 
same wireless receiver worked 
mine did n't - so , takes up two USB ports 
it does n't 
i have 
Had old key board 
using Logitech 's Unifying receiver 
have a good feel 
keyboard connects with systems using Logitech 's Unifying receiver , meaning 
it only uses one USB port 
which uses the same Logitech Unifying receiver 
do a lot 
this allowed me to play 
little usb device is inserted 
possibly match the typing comfort 
did some research 
keyboard fit the bill 
loving it 
key spacing and size does mirror the experience of a laptop keyboard so keep 
taking off the protective film 
that keeps reappearing 
times I clean it 
Warranty replaced it 
bought it because I needed 
that had a light 
that indicates if the caps lock is on 
recommend this keyboard 
Most of these wireless keyboards are designed for iPads ... whereas this is a true Windows keyboard 
n't have the CTRL key 
problem w 
Works as intended , saves space 
Just ordered a second one 
it would not charge 
Received a new exchange free 
owned 2-3 of these keyboards over the years , because they 're basically my go-to keyboard 
get a lot 
right on the front so it 's easy to just turn it off , wipe a cloth 
These do n't have a million goofy features 
drivers do n't do a bunch weird crap 
It does n't hurt 
set somebody else 
ever gotten new ones 
keep it 
also got a new one once because I was sick 
it seemed like I was typing 
had my old keyboard 
often take keyboards for granted 
much a good one can really make a difference 
give it six stars if I could put 
LOVE THIS KEYBOARD 
where quick keys were used 
recently got a desk job 
stretching my fingers 
often had given me a pain 
wanted a keyboard 
hands have had barely any pain since I got 
made the purchase 
use one USB to connect 
Already had one 
bought a second one 
however i hate the gloss 
rather have had the matt finich 
i needed an keyboard 
take on business trips 
purchased this 
It has worked wonderfully 
still has the full number pad 
Keeps your arms close 
use it 
paired this 
that was decently priced 
ordered this to help 
clean up the amount 
using this keyboard 
where everyone can hear you as you lead 
stand-up desk set 
want it 
n't really use much 
leave it to logitech 
size for travel ... fits perfect 
where you can store the usb receiver if you have 
it recognized it 
which works perfectly 
already owned a unifying mouse 
arrived , I simply launched the Logitech Unifying Software 
Gets every keystroke 
buttons have about a 1/4inch height so I have 
wireless connection stays strong when I am using 
have an older computer desk 
Larger keyboards do n't fit well 
setting it 
took it everywhere I traveled 
never had any problems 
it would put it 
anyone is looking 
that saves space and easy to travel 
really need a new one 
getting a new computer 
wanted a new keyboard 
Old one will stay 
purchased this keyboard to replace 
had a keyboard tray 
installed that 
used this new Logitech keyboard 
that had a near-useless trackpad 
It fits on the tray perfectly , leaving 
it still has a keypad 
LOVE it 
Glad I bought it 
Great device the only missing to make the best keyboard is back lit keys 
it 's supposed to 
pair my Logitech mouse 
Also , this thing gets knocked 
it has held up great 
have alternate input devices before this thing breaks 
Ergonomic , quality built , good price 
actually using it 
wont make a difference until you forget 
place whatever 
n't reach the volume control 
it fits nice 
used a lot 
have an office full 
have nothing 
Never had a single problem 
definitely buy it again 
Just what i wanted 
Replacing a bigger one 
that needs to fit 
This works great 
given no problems 
typing feels solid 
easily lasts a few months 
It has all the function keys of a normal keyboard plus a number pad so it is great 
use this 
prefer a separate wrist pad 
that I can move around 
Logitech offered a virtually identical illuminated model 
Current Logitech illuminated 
keyboards such as the K74 felt flimsy 
product uses the Logitech Unifying Receiver 
keyboard uses two AA batteries 
keys have very short travel 
forgetting it somewhere 
replaced a $ 150 Logitech G15 gaming keyboard 
flat keys make typing more difficult 
n't had any problems 
it 8hrs 
loves it 
job done 
Using it now 
uses very little battery power 
what i needed it for -LRB- work -RRB- i 'm very pleased 
what it cost 
Nice keyboard , feels really good 
Logitech rarely dissappoints 
it does n't slide 
nice firm feel 
use it 
Easy set 
Looks slick , easy 
keeps a size similar 
It included the number keys 
keyboards work 
use these keyboards 
man can do it 
Connecting the keyboard 
All you have to do is download and run the unifying software 
then turn the keyboard off 
software takes care 
it was working any way 
software did n't detect the keyboard 
unifying receiver allows you to use 
attach the small receiver 
carry your mouse 
Then when you get back to your desk your keyboard will work 
keyboard comes packaged 
that keeps the box 
requires no tools other 
Included in the box are the keyboard 
inexpensive , work horse keyboard then look no further 
buy it again 
fingerprints accumulate too easily 
keyboard has n't disappointed 
has a good feel 
it is engaged 
have 2 
lockso have to remember 
bought this 
cat decided to pop 
lose several keys 
just pulled it 
use the keyboard 
Also I have the Logitech trackball mouse 
assigned different programs to open 
just what I wanted thanks 
Exactly what I needed 
Still using it about a year later 
how it works and was EXTREMELY grateful for the included batteries because I did not anticipate 
that plugs 
Enter '' key on my laptop stopped working 
had a really small keyboard 
that I had used 
researched a LOT 
have a lot 
found this one 
liked it 
loving it 
only had it 
using the keys 
n't had any issue 
it takes for the words to `` catch 
possibly buying the universal receiver since I also have 
's no delay 
however this keyboard does make the grade as far 
keyboard worked 
build is not flimsy 
keyboard came with Duracell batteries installed 
why this surprised me so much 
buttons are only slightly raised from the keyboard body so one does not have 
which virtually stack the keys next 
quality makes it harder to accidentally press 
keyboard lasts 
Next model of this should have dedicated 
It comes 
keys are separated so they can be identified 
it turns 
only problem would be that 
still has the full number pad 
Works great with my windows laptop , compact so it does n't take a lot 
This seems to be a really nice keyboard 
it was touched 
first one I bought developed a terrible squeak 
company sent a new one out 
new one has had no problems 
it has the programmable `` hot keys 
using the keyboard 
Purchased this keyboard 
had no trouble 
it also comes 
have two 
batteries in my first one have lasted two years so far 
expect the ones in this one to do 
that fits easily 
It comes 
use the keyboard 
have no issues 
n't use the top row 
only using it 
it and the keys are spaced out perfectly 
This is buy far my favorite keyboard 
bought it 
It just takes some time to get used 
having a wire 
It works great 
couple multiple devices 
black keys look good 
just like the black shiny piano fingerprints leap off your hands 
keep the microfiber nearby 
that were n't I programmed to fit 
touch typists out there , sorry 
already using a Logitech unifying mouse when I replaced 
That left 
guessed it 
downloaded the latest SetPoint 
it works well 
dongle needs to be facing 
it works fine 
recommend the K360 
probably would n't guess it 
control the playback -LRB- Play , Pause , Forward , Backward -RRB- , MediaMonkey has to be the active window 
This does not affect your ability to control volume at any time as that is a system function 
control volume 
getting the wrong impression 
n't want anyone 
So if you 're in Excel hammering away on your retirement spreadsheet you ca n't jump past that track you hate , however you can mute it 
how the keys are all spaced 
when every inch counts 
compromising the keyboard layout too much 
It does n't feel like a compact keyboard when you are typing 
use this in my classroom so I can have 
It works great 
recommend it 
buy this again 
Exactly what I need 
it did n't strain my hands too much 
described as en ergonomic keyboard , I find this comfortable enough 
It fits my space perfectly 
bought the MK360 package 
that has the Unifying Receiver 
So , I bought this one 
USB receiver plugged 
covering the gloss finish 
this attracts fingerprints 
press each keystroke 
It does n't take much effort 
keys are separated 
It has great function buttons 
that work 
not pay any more than $ 20 , though 
reading my review 
made it this 
Keyboard works great 
keys are spaced so you can type 
had work 
also used this keyboard with another brand of mouse -LRB- using 
use Logitech devices 
Also the fact that has a numeric keyboard makes it very useful 
that has a numeric keyboard 
Took all of 30 seconds to install 
usning this daily for some time now -LRB- several months -RRB- , never turn it 
still have the original batteries 
buying this keyboard 
composed a dissertation 
had the first one 
just wasted 9.99 
that I threw 
Read the reviews before buying 
who 've had a bad experience 
Exactly what I needed 
keys work well 
Logitech provides a full -LRB- although paperless -RRB- guide 
that has the number pad 
pad on the side makes it very easy 
start off the review 
purchased this keyboard second handed because it was cheaper 
that was messed 
bad boy was working 
plugged in the USB , remove the film 
how I wanted it to be 
that will not make much noise as I have 
Good quality product , as described and arrived same day I purchased it

Solid connection , works

using it 
use it right away 
Easy to use , functions well 
always purchased Logitech products 
it has a very good feel 
Just switched the sticker 
This replaced a 4 year old keyboard 
Great quality , works perfect , just as described 
made Logitech my choice when I had 
It works as it is suppose 
likes this keyboard so much 
bought a second one 
it has a light 
that indicates cap-lock 
keys have a little spring 
which makes it a plus 
Liked the one I purchased for home use approx 7 months ago so much 
purchased another 
really enjoy chiclet-style keys 
keyboard was purchased 
which for me has improved accuracy when typing 
still using the same two batteries 
highly recommend this Logitech K360 
wanting a compact wireless keyboard 
functions work well 
i have no complaints 
keep it in my laptop bag in case I need 
use it 
keyboard turned out to be great 
keys were going to be small 
keys feel even better 
it works great 
bought this sleek little beauty 
that I found 
keyboard must have a number keypad on it since I work 
that came 
set-up took less 
anyone could do it 
finally did it 
that with smaller keys comes less noise 
it gets used 
using this 
had , over the years , very good luck 
couple of people mentioned the spacing 
keys themselves are not tapered 
it give the illusion 
measured the space 
that was curved 
constantly moving it to use 
enjoying this product 
completely taken off guard by how adorably small -LRB- but not ridiculously small -RRB- this keyboard is 
it 's not cheaply made 
windows 10 recognized the keyboard 
USB wireless detector came attached 
It minimizes the space while the keys are sufficiently spaced/sized 
wife uses a third K360 
it comes 
work the same 
rather have the un-glossed version 
It has quite a few keys 
that can be programmed 
use the unifying software 
which you are not supposed to do 
Great keyboard , slim and small sized , the high gloss surface requires some maintenance 
eat or drink next to it -LRB- which you are not supposed to do anyway -RRB- then occasional wiping with sanitizer will take care 
Use it meanly for typing , so far very comfortable 
Personally I prefer the white keyboard 
now have one 
concerned about key placement ... just use it 
Buy a few so you can use 
did this first 
buying a second one 
had this keyboard 
It has super low latency 
never lags or skips a key 
recommend this 
who needs a good cheap keyboard 
Really enjoying this keyboard 
Keys have a great and solid feel 
keyboard works great unifiying usb 
n't even notice the size 
have smaller hands 
It connects to my laptop instantly when I turn 
n't need it 
recommend this product 
left the plastic on it to prevent 
it works perfectly

Definitely recommend it 
bought this keyboard when I started 
found this 
using it 
admin of my department noticed it right away 
ordered one for herself as

simple pair of AA batteries makes it super

advertisement states 
just bought my third version 
bought my first one to try 
stole the one 
oredered my latest one , it came 
Definitely give it a shot 
n't had it long

i like that it 's very compact yet the keys are not still not too close to each other , they remove the portion 
moved the arrows 
light and compact , i take this home or in meetings with my laptop when i need 
laptop does not have the number key pad 
little guy takes care 
loving it 
Typing my review 
It does it 
fingers have a tendency 
wear the letters 
often , students need to use 
have two keyboards 
keyboard shows absolutely no signs of such wear yet 
it seems to be holding 
need a keyboard 
letters start to wear 
use this thing 
where i was putting my keyboard 
it gives another space for my mouse to be used 
buttons click great 
it doesnt block 
i am using this 
volume and playback worked without setting 
i uses the playback keys 
it works great

It looked a little small 
highly recommend it 
keys do take 
little getting used 
cheap wireless keyboards work great 
offered it 
Great - Very Happy - Wish they offered it in flat instead of high gloss black - Would buy again 
Affordable , sleek looking 
bought this keyboard 
really helps accuracy 
it has a numeric keypad 
had a numeric keypad 
It feels durable 
keys have just the right amount 
keyboard claims to get 
hopefully this ends up being true 
It actually works great with Mac even though it does n't claim 
swap the command 
thing you 'll want to do is go to `` System Preferences '' > `` Keyboard '' > `` Modifier Keys '' and swap the command and option keys so that it behaves 
keys do n't seem to do 
Previous , and volume/mute keys all work great 
Logitech did a great job 
providing a good bang 
's a reason 
Product works great just as most Logitech products do 
else Logitech I own -LRB- lots -RRB- , this is superbly designed 
yet it all ` falls readily 
given this a 4.5 , as my old-fashioned hands would have loved 
also have one 
prefer the keys 
want one 
yes , it uses the unifying thingie 
has all the keys 
keys feel good 
products work well 
Enjoying my keyboard 
Just what I was looking for ... it is sleek , compact , the keys are soft ... perfect for reduced space and works as it should 
purchased it to use 
All went well 
good keyboard for the price i use it every

quality of the keys feels great and I 've had it for about a year now and have n't had to replace the batteries yet , even though I use 
having a wireless keyboard 
have a small work workspace 
purchased this keyboard for its small size while still maintaining 
It fits that bill perfectly 
keys have a mechanical feel 
using this keyboard daily 
battery is still displaying as full 
provides the ability 
gain some additional control without needing 
highly recommend this 
got this keyboard to be able 
use it 
It has worked flawlessly in the two months I 've been using 
it has had no problems 
which some other keyboards do not include 
also liked the volume control keys 
store the dongle internally 
which I have to take 
only downside to this keyboard is not having a backlight 
cared enough to have it , I would have gotten one 
recommend it unequivocally 
However , if you anticipate using it in the dark frequently and do n't mind sacrificing battery life and a little extra cash , I suggest one 
update this if anything changes 
It looks Apple 
what I need it 
having new MacBookPro 
it works 
also used it 
just ordered another 
Rheumatoid Arthritis hit my right fast 
completed miserable then Trigger Finger

Easy to carry 
Easy to use

Provides adequate wrist support 
gel feels great 
It also keeps your desk from getting

that holds it 
just left the protective paper 
that 's working 
used an Intellimouse 
It makes things ricey 
Exactly what I needed 
It has a sturdy finish

Who knew this wireless mouse 
LOVE THE ABILITY 
dongle and this things works great

just played a few FPS games on my PC to make 
purchased this sooner

It 's made 
this comes in

heavy guage cord yet it has a nice flexibility to it compared to a lot 
trust this supplier 
well made product 
what more can you ask 
keep your laptop charge 
Good quality cable wo n't overheat 
nice high quality rubber feel , not cheap plastic 
what I needed 
it works its a cable 
far I 've had it 
what to write here 
Ordered this one 
It works great 
having a longer power cord 
that fits perfectly 
Definitely will use this vendor again when I need 
that have been upgraded 
have an old house 
This gives me the length 
n't been using it long 
Prompt delivery 
computer plugged in 
who have to use 
Compared to other cords I 've bought , both online and in-store , This one seems relatively well constructed 
Plus , a 15 foot cord for the price ca n't be beat 
that means 
that had come 
bought it to replace 
cord had frayed back 
cord feels much sturdier 
that came 
cords fit perfectly 
's no way 
used it 
It also works well 
TP-Link N150 is AUTOMATICALLY recognized 
Adaptor worked as advertised 
it would do 
what it said 
Needed a small 5G adp 
this did 
far works fine 
install works 
Plugged it 
configured my wi-fi to use 
had excellent results 
It 's working flawlessly so far 
n't need dual band since I only wanted 
using other TP-Link adapters 
Recently my internet provider , Xfinity , upgraded 
that had dualband cabablities 
only getting 43Mbps with my built 
now I have been averaging a download speed 
It has a green light 
n't experienced any dropped signals 
It has a great span 
adapter works exactly as advertised 
not have a 5Ghz wireless card 
small adapter took a few tries to get up and running but now I am able to access the 5Ghz band on my router and internet speeds have improved 
this immediately found my wifi signal on desktop very satisified 
loading drivers 
having wireless USB Adapter 
this a must have 
small size plus performance make 
needed something to replace 
i have had this mouse 
technical issues ceased 
know the life expectancy 
Son loves the way it lights up 
wants the most ergonomic design to reduce 
it does not fail 
Great mouse it does not fail in the middle of a game like the old one did 
ordered this mouse because my Logitech G500 finally gave 
looks a lot different , the Samsara feels 
It will take me a while 
G500 had a rough texture 
Samsara on the other hand has the rough texture 
Samsara has more buttons 
it feels comparable to the G500 to me , only time will tell if it will last as long though , if it does n't I will update 
some say 
mouse feels cheap 
only time will tell if it will last 
just keeps cycling 
set the lights 
it does n't let 
Overall I really like this mouse , some things could be improved upon 
pay more for a gaming mouse when you can get 
n't see any reason 
dropped it 
even had one piece of the mouse pop off 
However , I popped the piece right back on and the mouse still works 
husband loves this 
G500 lasted for nearly 7 years before it 's time 
only had this Redragon 
n't use any macros 
it has that ability 
simply remap the buttons 
loves it 
it changes to are vibrant 
using it right now 
that wo n't be utilized 
who is looking 
not want one 
mouse has a good tactile feel 
software can be downloaded 
several modes enabled already 
lights change 
lights can not be changed 
custom map the mouse buttons for different applications/games , so it 's almost like playing 
n't light it up as one solid colour , so I have 
ordered many programmable mouses 
most have n't met my requirements 
what I required 
definately reorder this mouse as it did 
play Diablo 
mouse fits the bill 
cat absolutely loves the mouse !! 
which are easily indicated which 
software allows customization 
this lived 
mouse has 13 buttons 
buttons can be used as you please 
This has 5 different profiles 
settings that are changed within the profile will stay the same after switching to another profileI love this mouse it has stayed durable for a year now 
it has stayed durable 
that does not change 
Profile Can :1 -RRB- Have their own 5 dpi increments2 
have their own light 
that are changed 
profile is linked 
texture and shape of the mouse gives it a good grip 
change the flashing light style 
that I did not mention 
change the profile 
has 2 other buttons 
personally did not use the two buttons 
buttons on the top went 
personally loved the braided wire 
store the excess length 
It does have a Velcro Strap 
how it worked 
then create your shortcuts 
override the wrong profile 
profile you decided to change 
maybe someone else will find a good use 
n't ever need my dpi to go 
keep mine 
really enjoy this mouse 
choice or a solid color led 
that I would have like 
drop a durability score 
bottom laminated paper , bubbled 
That required 
remove it completely 
removed it completely because it was causing 
highly recommend this mouse 
actually use this for 3d modeling as well as gaming because the buttons are all super well placed 
LEDs for the mouse are n't programmed to be just one color 
which I prefer 
have pulsating changing lights 
hit the right one 
n't beat the price 
made this purchase 
n't just choose one color 
it kind of looks cool 
that bugged 
colors and patterns are easily customized 
loved the feel too 
Still , I wo n't hold it 
light color stay the same 
it does n't tell 
Programmable settings , incredible dpi , can be used 
it beats the price 
u get a better mouse 
this beats top brand mice 
used different type

loves abstract prints 
It has helped me a lot 
easing the pain

felt pain 
feel almost zero tension when I move 
piece has made a positive impact 
having a 8-10

articulating arm works very smoothly 
need more support so the longer arm rest would be better 
Amazingi can move my arm freely now while playingmy accuracy got 
needed some support 
this moves around -- both up 
Having the ability 
tune it both horizontally 
THING !!! 
Saved my wrist from becoming 
not recommend a better product 
who have wrist troubles 
point you look at it rotates 
getting terrible pain in my arm and shoulder from using 
device has helped me so much 
it can move up and 
really ca n't recommend this highly enough 
it 's there 
it adjusted 
get it adjusted to your preference you ca n't even tell it 's there , it articulates wonderfully 
this works 
have no complaints 
Hope it does not break 
using the rests 
it 's made a big difference 
always used two mice 
setup will reduce the chronic neckpain 
securing the rests 
move the rests 
it gets a bit tricky 
order the next one soon 
had severe shoulder pain 
This has made a dramatic difference 
got this to add 
easy to setup and work great my Arms are levelled with the table now so less strain 
Saw these babies 
have an ikea table 
put something to keep 
provides immediate relief 
found this 
using this 
product does a good job 
providing support 
it does n't get in the way as much 
When I bought this 
looks a bit 
use my computer 
support has changed the way 
It has virtually eliminated the stress 
It takes a bit 
designer , WELL DONE!It is made very well , very solid 
This is made 
it really helps 
This helps a lot 
Low desks or chairs with large armrests may interfere 
that would fit 
buy more for my other desk if I get 
it has eased the pain 
use this 
It instantly took the pain away 
pain would normally start after about 15 minutes off using 
hooked this badboy 
worked about 5 hours -LRB- with breaks -RRB- before I started 
easily put your own pad 
relieve strain 
feels a little weird 
it was going to be 
it is made 
it will last a lifetime 
combined it 
helped my carpal tunnel pain 
had the non-articulating one first 
it did n't work 
using my mouse 
purchased this to help 
It arrives 
unscrewing the base of the unit enough to fit 
make slight adjustments 
that 's needed 
then you tighten the knob to lock 
that works the same way 
wearing short sleeves , you may experience some minor sweating on the wrist rest if you use 
bought this on a whim just to try 
it would never work for me to reduce 
developed pretty severe shoulder pain 
So , over this time I 've tried various things to alleviate 
Enter the eLink Pro 
it would never work 
Once I saw it 
It glides easily it any position 
n't experienced any heat issues 
It swings out of the way when 
it has relieved all 
Coupled with a good chair , the eLink has forced me to sit 
have better posture while I 'm on the computer 
product has changed my life 
introduced it 
trying it 
It works so well 
It 's that comfortable 
work with the computer for any length of time or have shoulder pain , give this product a try 
have shoulder pain 
use a tablet 
are , my elbow was starting to hurt 
read a few reviews

only takes about 2 inches 
It also can raise up 
it would hamper my motion as I worked 
it does n't 
It glides with you as you move 
only had it 
gives a good feeling 
It seems really well made 
it does get a little warm where your arm/elbow sits 
made this purchase

i had 
arms get 
have Lou Gehrig 's disease 
weaker this simple armrest allows me to continue 
originally brought this because I was feeling 
elbows dip 
This did not work for us as we need 
that will allow the user to extend 
This seemed like a good quality product , however 
it just did n't meet our needs so we returned 
item was packaged well 
Seller shipped quickly 
using this 
shoulder and arm are already feeling better 
product saved my arm 
then immediately ordered 2 more pair to use 
ELIMINATES wrist pain 
vertical axes swing fluidly 
material does n't seem to breathe well , prolonged use in heat can be uncomfortable 
see CON

clearance between bottom twisting part of clamp might limit placement 
avoid bumping 
Top of desk clamp is padded to protect 
work 12 hour days 
supports my arm well 
It is very well constructed

It adjusts nicely 
use it primarily 
put my elbow in it most of the time so my arm is straight at the mouse

it 's got pretty lights 
lights are easily seen 
It fits nicely 
10/10 would definitely recommend 
Not expecting much 
simple design makes it easy to use 
colors you want 
Quality made , great feel 
n't spend more 
bought it to match 
Corsair STRAFE RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard 
no means a PC Keyboard 
mouse surely gives other higher priced mouses 
bought this mouse 
loves it 
that ca n't be beat 
fits the hand nicely 
has a nice , long braided cable 
has four different pre-set DPIs 
that can be cycled 
that can be further tweaked 
that will add a bit 
install the drivers 
give it a minute 
plug it 
It has a good weight onto the mouse also 
needed a mouse 
easily change its DPI settings 
mouse worked quickly 
ordering the mouse

These do a nice job

still giving it 5 stars as it 's a very useful item 
need more 
job done 
keep the clutter 
that does not seem the case 
securely hold down your cords 
it does n't look too bulky 
buttons are working well for things like organizing the excess USB cable for my wife 's smart phone charger when she is using 
organizing the excess USB cable 
buttons are made from black rubber compound and the package included 
adhesive backing holds them securely in place and they are working just as designed , so overall 
charging cables lined up instead of always 
adhesive sticks well , and the size has worked 
Does the job 
This seems 
two hold a few computer cords 
using it 
Holds wires 
easy to get cords in an cables stay put , so far-so 
Just what I needed 
These were just what i needed to hold 
have a ton of mobile and portable devices that require charging cables , so I have 
that require charging 
help organize 
recommend these 
who are tired 
product is perfectly executed 
build quality 
have a high 
adhesive on the back ensures a strong hold 
highly recommend these 
holds all my wires well 
removing them , the sticky side comes 
Easy to attach 
get the wire 
more could you ask 
use these everywhere 
holders really do the job 
the seem to be of identical quality 
have these 
decluttering the cables 
that reset 
setup under and on the sides of my computer desk and night stand 
Really cleans things 
felt silly playing 
played it 
has wonderful graphics 
playing it 
gets a trip out of seeing 
how to solve this level without dying 
share my hobby 
game ran fluidly 
sounds like Mickey and all of the sound effects were in place 
then introduces all sorts 
It plays 
timing a jump 
collected only about half 
game has some replayability 
Gems are hidden 
others take a great deal 
So if you 're willing to put in the extra time -LRB- I 'd suspect an additional 6 or 7 hours -RRB- , you can get all 
suspect an additional 6 or 7 hours 
Is this game 
have a great time 
Have fun 
pun intended 
this brings back memories 
loved the world 
i wanted to play 
now i got a such a wonderful time 
i could n'tbut 
play the sega genesis version 
Need more remakes 
game brings back the early days 
played the crud 
n't have a Genesis 
played the Genesis original then 
loved it when others did 
even picked up the Epic Mickey spinoff 
game almost has 
side scrolling rpg feel to it since you can run 
running this game 
it looks absolutely stunning 
developers fixed the fps 
setting and I can run more than 30fps easily 
relax and enjoy a stunning game 
recommend this game 
purchased this 
what you 're thinking 
that 's 
end that preconception 
need a controller 
how to use it 
daughter passed the controller to me because the timing on jumps , especially in the clouds , is not for rookies 
figure out the pattern 
playing those bosses more 
that I play another chapter 
daughter refers to it as movie when she requests 
spaced it out to one a day as a chapter takes 
Anyways , she loves it 
purchased it 
that 's a steal 
It feels 
turning the mouse 
It has a comfortable shape 
Construction seems sturdy 
n't have an auto-off feature so you have 
do , the battery lasts 
Use it 
it never fails 
tried the Amazon basics 
It felt good 
it never falter 's 
use it 
left handed 
some getting used to , being set 
It took 
when I 'm using Microsoft Word 
Ca n't ask 
where it does n't feel cheap like a lot of wireless mouses can 
It feels great in your hand , has enough weight 
it reacts great 
auto shut down/power 
what i need it to do 
i wanted a wireless mouse because it makes 
mouse does 
Easy to use ... plug 
it is well made 
inserted the nano receiver 
it tracks well 
slight ratcheting click as it moves 
it has 
audible click from the left and right buttons , though not anywhere near an obtrusive level 
description said 
insert said 
it has a traditional on/off switch 
take extra large gloves 
this fits my hand well 
It has some weight 
use my Logitech 325 travel mouse 
which I prefer 
bought the black mouse because I refuse 
included one 
It has a rubber insert 
lacks one 
just got this so I ca n't speak 
it has a good feel 
question I have is will it hold 
It comes 
register on line then they will extend it 
then essentially it turns 
using it 
recommend it 
it took me a while to figure 
it works great 
use this daily 
using Logitech meeses 
it 's gone down the same path as their keyboards , no longer a quality item ... totally different 
So I ordered this little mouse 
years of heavy use like the original Loggies did 
's see if it lasts 
saw this one for pretty cheap so I went 
it works flawlessly 
scroller might not work 
n't have huge hands 
one fits me great 
actually get a lot of use out of the buttons on the left side of it too 
It goes to sleep 
does the job 
n't cross my mind 
that costs more than $ 
It has a very nice look 
clicking feels very nice 
it fits great 
it feels 
never failed me.-Battery life 
only used it 
it is supposed to be around an 18 month mark 
yet.-USB connector fits 
opened the mouse to insert the batteries , I could n't really find the USB connector 
it 's safely stored inside the mouse , right 
buy it 
n't regret it 
button really makes the mouse even better 
ever owned all the way back to 1983 when I first started 
purchased countless Microsoft mice 
have three dead Microsoft mice in front of me right now 
It will not work 
purchased Logitech mice 
n't buy any more 
mouse works well 
still see my computer monitor to know 
mouse is responding 
it can go further 
It does n't consume much power as it goes 
never purchase another overprice Microsoft or Logitech mouse the rest 
it looks quite robust 
Time will tell 
make a high quality wireless keyboard 
reviews won 
it and well worth the money spent 
It fits well 
which helps to conserve 
use this 
It works perfectly 
fast the tracking should be , based 
that adjusts 
It even has a button 
find this explained in the manual , that seems to be what the clear button does 
this explained 
back and forward buttons are very comfortably and conveniently placed right above the thumb and work very well to switch 
recommend it 
this has not disappointed 
used Tecknet Mice before 
mouse feels heavier 
It does n't feel too heavy 
Material - Has rubber 
has a good feel 
not had any glitches of any sort while using 
mouse seems very good 
n't observed any lag 
not require any setup .4 
Battery - Ca n't comment 
lot of mice do n't have this as they turn 
where the mouse gets clicked when in my bag and turns on my PC while it is in sleep mode 
had a lot 
having an on/off switch 
mouse also turns off after inactivity to save 
store the USB connector 
n't lose it when carrying 
connector is just plugged 
It also indicates the current DPI setting 
mouse also does not have a light 
that consume power needlessly 
really impressed by the reliability I have seen , the feel 
bot have replaced 
1 is used 
more can I say 
already own a gaming keyboard 
have your left 
what I recommend 
Uses 2 AA 
buy a 4 rechargeable battery pack to always have 
it does come with a LED light to tell 
n't seen any lag 
so I just turn it off when I 'm not gaming 
defiantly recommend it 
Excellent mouse for the money , install 
figure it 
use 1 USB adapter 
suprisingly it does n't atract fingerprints 
mouse is not made 
It has a light frame 
take a hit 
mice that TeckNet make are usually very well put together and can take a hit , however i can not bring my self to damage a wireless mouse , as the mouse could go 
that TeckNet make 
however i can not bring my self to damage 
Overall this mouse 's portable , and light frame make it great 
who uses a portable PC 
play games 
purchased this mouse 
old computer mouse was failing 
tested it first to see 
it works exactly as expected 
's not much 
It does the job exactly 
It feels comfortable 
buttons work exactly as expected 
definitely purchase it again 
handles it easily 
enjoy games 
that you can program to preform 
It also has two buttons 
more can I say 
and back buttons on the side really help 
Might update it 
it worked 
awesome this one does n't seem to disappoint 
first was bought 
bought this 
this works 
never changed anything 
probably lose mouse before it runs 
battrey so make it little heavy 
bought this mouse to use 
shape gives a firm grip 
just has a great aesthetic to it as 
store the USB chip adapter 
Definitely get it while it 's still cheap 
it works really great 
not eat up batteries 
It goes 
change the speed 
other thing that I was surprised about is it actually came 
Great buy 
it 's a steal 
it has a decent weight 
just wiggle it 
it 'll reactivate 
has a few mouse speed settings 
It also has n't actually caught fire while I was actively using 
Do some research 
Last HP mouse was voraciously consuming two AA batteries every two days for a week before I gave 
Ca n't happen 
Product works well 
it fits my hand very nicely 
Now I have the comfort 
It moves very easily when using 
used different brands 
that broke some days ago 
also bought this mouse 
that needed a solid blutooth mouse 
It feels great 
once you install the batteries 
batteries , and off it went 
Just received the mouse 
wanting to pay a lot for a wireless mouse , I tried TeckNet 's small Optical mouse 
new design offers even more features 
It has some weight 
using it to play 
it 's working great 
using it 
Here we have your standard 2.4 GHz wireless connection , complete 
TeckNet has delivered a much better 
lost my match 
rubber on the thumb indent keeps things 
mouse does not disappoint 
large hands fit comfortably 
sensor tracks well 
TeckNet calls this sensor their `` BlueWave Pro '' , though -LRB- on my unit -RRB- it displays 
not to have visible light 
fine by me , I prefer not to have visible light emitting from the bottom of my mice , less distraction 
include a picture 
showing this blue light 
change the DPI 
count the number 
level your current DPI is set to is 
Overall build quality seems decent 
it wo n't `` wow 
build quality 
clicks have a good tactile feedback 
this includes the side buttons 
that balances the need for speed and precision quite well 
TeckNet claims 
It does seem to go 
Overall I 'd highly recommend this 
When Changing DPI -RRB- Shiny 
Nice remote accurate description and fast shipment very happy with my mouse would recommend 
This has to be the very best user 
that has ever been designed 
have 1 AA Battery in order to use 
mouse does n't come 
remove the gloss finish 
is to remove the gloss finish , it can get a little sticky when the moisture builds 
This came 
plugged the dongle 
it recognized it immediately 
It uses two AA batteries 
dongle is tucked into the battery compartment when it arrives 
that does the job 
that feels as responsive 
mouse worked flawlessly 
It has all the utility features 
that some have 
missing the colorful lights 
not have an issue 
past devices would not always give smooth results 
tech had peaked 
change DPI 
using this mouse with it 's ability 
totally recommending this mouse 
USB plug-in can be kept under your mouse when you 're not using 
so you wo n't lose it 
accidentally left the mouse on for a few hours while not being used 
highly recommend it 
who constantly uses a mouse 
testing out mice 
which looks very similar 
previously tried out TeckNet 's Bluetooth mouse 
it uses two AA batteries 
which gives it a more solid weight 
It works perfectly and easily right out of the box when I tried 
Works great with my chrome book , will buy another 
it is working out so well 
which fits my large hands quite well 
keep it when not in use 
stored in the base so taught 
USB receiver came 
MACBOOK accepted it without blinking showing 
tried several different surfaces to see 
affect its operation 
which had lots 
tried it 
tell no difference 
really do n't need a mouse pad 
put the mouse pad up because less effort was required 
make less mistakes 
base of the mouse has a dedicated on/off switch 
n't really need it as it has 
turn things off when I want 
life is claimed to be 30 months 
use of a dark mouse pad draws more energy 
wave the mouse back and forth to make 
use more battery there too 
Only time will tell 
mouse is programmed 
selection of this can be done by pushing 
perhaps when the mouse goes 
it has to do 
use under other operating systems may reduce mouse functionality 
Finally , the specifications are listing this mouse 
mouse takes 
it works fine 
only issue I had was when I initially received the mouse , I opened the package 
not see the Wireless USB plug 
reported this 
waiting over the weekend for a reply I took out the mouse , opened the battery cover to verify 
took out the mouse 
works this well for my old Apple , it should fly 
keep their products 
easy this makes using

Ever lost one 
putting the batteries in and the dongle in the laptop it fired

certainly buy it again 
It has a good weight 
which are not included 
Aesthetically it could do 
Usually I use a wired mouse

Regardless , I 've been using these TeckNet wireless mice 
wireless mouse works 
wonderful would tell everybody to buy 
purchased this mouse recently 
it 's working great so far 
one works great 
that may annoy people 
it feels very light weight 
takes a second 
where it does n't recognize movement until you click 
wake it 
using the mouse it appear to go 
not using it 
what 's going 
take you a second 
All in all , if you 're looking for a pretty nice mouse for a great price , then get this one 
that is uses AA batteries as well 
many of my past mice this size have wanted AAA batteries 
have 1 AA rechargeable battery 
which I 've been using 
have 2 of those AA rechargeables , tho I have n't had 
register online 
overwhelmingly recommend the Tecknet M006 
really liked this mouse 
n't want anything 
mainly use it 
It has a nice solid feel 
fits my hands well 
what all of the buttons do 
kids will teach 
made some slight ergonomical adjustments here

Ill definitely buy another one of these for sure 
attaching pictures

get a lot 
it took a bit for it to sync 
It works great 
gotten three keyboards 
spilled on this keyboard it still worked

Makes life a lot easier when you can type normal 
it , arrived on time just as advertised 
Love it , arrived on time just as advertised ... will buy from seller again

Received yesterday & received so many compliments !!!

Just stick the usb 
wait a few seconds 
had slight issue 
new sproker thank you very muchVivian 
use this keyboard 
Anyone familiar with that knows 
design of this keyboard keeps water/sand/dirt from being trapped 
USB dongle stored 
button has to be pressed 
it does n't take long to get used 
types so quietly I would recommend this 
keyboard is lifted 
got this for my daughter to use 
The on board keyboard was going screwy 
insert the text 
what she had already typed 
that is also built to last 
that would work 
wanted something 
i did n't want to spend 
it responds nicely 
loves the color 
mouse works great 
run off one nano usb receiver 
mouse takes a AA battery 
that do n't have consistently good reviews 
got the gold one 
mouse works perfectly 
bar makes a bit 
inexpensive keyboard and mouse duo exceeded my expectations 
u need it 
Best gaming mouse i have so far 
it 's refurbished 
flaws , works perfectly 
use it 
It looks brand new 
Seriously would not buy any other brand 
it look cool 
it works great 
using this 
make different profiles to fit 
played a few hundred hours 
weight of the mouse feels perfect 
brother used it 
it still worked perfectly 
use it 
i have ever used 
adjust the dpi 's the way you want to , because it has 
recommend this product 
bought a second mouse to use 
go the refurbished route 
that normal products do n't go through 
units typically have exceedingly stringent QA processes 
get an even higher-quality product 
buying another one 
just need an ergonomic mouse 
that 's just if you 're nitpicking 
using this mouse 
now it matches my chroma keyboard 
only had wireless mice 
still use my mouse 
old double click issue begin happening 
Which would literally drive me crazy 
time wanted a performance mouse 
that fit my visual needs 
few buddies of mine have one 
which they had no complaints 
PRO 's : - Feel - Clicks - LED 's - 10,000 DPI - ResponsivenessCON 's - Does n't have a DPI button on the mouse -LRB- Have to adjust via software -RRB- - Does n't come 
Clicks - LED 's - 10,000 DPI - ResponsivenessCON 's - Does n't have a DPI button 
mouse literally looks 
scratch on it , and buttons feel very new 
definitely recommend this mouse 
find many `` gaming '' products too gaudy 
who need only the basic features 
that your in-box OEM mouse just is n't going to deliver 
still want a quality , high-performance product 
enjoy it 
using the DeathAdder 
Razer has stayed true 
Might have to pick 
Device came as described 
thus far .10,000 dpi makes 
however I do a lot 
not play fps 
Mouse came in slightly bigger 
Ignore anything 
build quality 
wanted an all metal mouse 
It also has a beautiful color glow 
item as described ... tested ok 
Seems brand new 
that I have ever bought 
i recommend this 
always enjoyed the DeathAdder mouse 
own the original DeathAdder 
that I 'm used 
device came `` certified refurbished '' , so it did n't have 
referencing Razer 's social media pages 
Instead , it included two single-page green papers 
booklet basically just shows you how to plug 
referencing a rewards program 
Mouse!Comparing the Chroma 
which has been added 
Also , there 's a small grippy rubber patch 
soon as I plugged it in , the mouse 's Razer logo and scroll wheel started cycling 
that can be changed very easy using 
just take my word 
Mileage will probably vary 
used the Synapse software 
software works wonderfully 
running the Developer Preview 
then configure it so that the mouse switches 
also tie button configurations 
respectively , then save the profile so that it turns 
want the thumb buttons to stop 
initiate that profile whenever Chrome is open 
Alternative , you can make another profile 
that lets 
rate you want to use 
n't have much use 
play multiple games 
Again , these can be saved 
have both the wheel 
's a setting 
It allows you to calibrate 
have a Razer mat , you can select it 
it should auto-calibrate 
Otherwise , you can manually add a mat 
just click Custom Mat 
it will let 
quickly calibrate the mouse so that it works 
most mouse pads work 
people have relating 
that could fix minor/major issues 
It 's an awesome update for my old , dying 
click broke 
had the DeathAdder for 3 + years , if I 'm not mistaken 
device looks 
feels brand new 
Took a while

tablet has taken my daughter 's art 
takes a lot 
using the pen , you can see the little line marks 
That 's concerning 
it comes with is okay 
n't test it to the fullest because there 's 
it comes 
It works great 
little sister loved the tablet 
save the electronic files 
kids do some really good art 
each have their own portfolio to go 
It takes 
little getting used 
also use it instead of the mouse to navigate 
creating artwork 
Wonderful package and kids are having a blast 
got this

Wacom usually does n't disappoint

who loves to draw 
quick call to the helpful people at their 800 number got us up 
Had a little trouble 
daughter starts using 
surface surely feels 
n't need the eraser 
It really gets the job done 
n't beat Wacom with it comes 
compact and thin yet gives you all the control 
've your own software already , just pick up whatever lowest price 
live this thing already 
getting the hang 
what I needed 
it does 
that unlocked my creativity 
had no problems whatsoever 
It works very well 
Using a drawing tablet 
some getting used to but this one was easy 
daughter really enjoys using 
it works well 
registering it 
getting support 
thing started 
plugged it 
downloaded the needed software 
it registered 
It felt ... a little too light 
needed it to be as close 
it works just fine 
who has never really done digital art 
pad takes time 
deserve a tablet 
people complain 
drawing on a computer , you have the ability 
adding small details 
usually have my mouse and/or trackpad nearby so I prefer 
little getting used to if you 've never drawn 
pen takes 
soon it 'll feel like you 're drawing 
n't mind the lack of an eraser end , since that feature is more 
flip the pen around 
it comes 
connect the tablet 
included cable fits snugly into the top , so you do n't need 
cable also juts out the top left side 
which cuts down on cord clutter if you keep 
who 's into drawing 
using it 
purchased this tablet to replace 
also giving me issues 
had no issues 
use this table 
sensitivity works well to adjust 
accuracy seems perfect 
which seems to work 
n't use that function much 
Essentially you can use the table 
not found any issues 
tried out the buttons 
tablets have never let 
everything appears 
pen had bigger buttons , though 
pushing the buttons 
do photography 
getting use 
tablets work 
where it shows 
Where you put the pen on the pad is 
set up my shortcuts 
tossed it 
disconnected my mouse 
which I have set 
pen itself has two buttons 
buttons on the pad itself I set up for some mac functions though I do n't use 
also set up your pen 
that do one thing 
So you can program buttons 
It comes with some nice free apps , though I have opted 
offer you the apps 
n't really have it all that long before I went 
it works great 
once it 's set 
carried mine from my PC at home to my Mac at work and connect to both with no problem , though I prefer 
pics I drew and colored using Wacom 
why people complained 
casing comes 
easily if you follow the directions 
pen slips 
slide it 
not pry it 
Also , it stays 
it comes with is amazing 
Highly recommend this 
that may be looking for a cheaper product temporarily

also use it as a mouse when it 's plugged 
it does n't take long 
dumping a load of money into a drawing tablet , you get great introductory performance 
Finally these products do 
what they are supposed to do 
that came with it is great 
It feels like you are drawing 
daughter absolutely loves this pen 
spends hours

creating her own characters 
Daughter loved it

LOVE this tablet 
what you draw

stylus and everything works perfectly 
said , installing is quick 
grandson likes it 
drawing pad has everything 
that makes a great storage container 
it even comes 
that makes this tablet kind 
that comes 
find the free software 
However there 's nothing 
that does n't make it awesome 
better programs included 
what I expected 
loves all 
tablet does take a little time 
who is just starting to draw 
it works very well 
turn the touch sensitivity off you can rest 
lines come out very fluid 
when using the pen 
Buttons seem easy 
had problems 
it all worked 
found everything 
Some said 
trial , you do not get a real copy 
i am very amused 
great tablet , it will take some time 
learn all 
likes it 
choose the medium size version 
have space 
it will help you a lot 
had several tablets 
slight learning curve discourage 
much better thing thing is compared 
draw that 
Drawing stuff 
navigate extensive menu settings 
who wanted to get 
used the Bamboo Capture 
uses a pen tablet , one will never want to use 
giving this product a 5/5 not 
exactly what I expect 
read a few negative reviews 
product felt ` cheap 
involved either driver issues 
registering the product 
Meaning no offense 
n't had any experience 
that had legitimate hardware failure 
's not much 
experienced precisely none 
have more experience 
error had quite a bit 
Good rule of thumb , install the driver and software BEFORE you connect 
Wacom writes 
took about 30 seconds 
making a new account 
have high hopes 
Now if this sucker fails on me in the next few weeks , this review might change a bit 
use it

some of the pen tablet functions do n't even work 
everything works great 
use it

consist of 75 % or more of just drawing and editing , you should probably get a pro 
spend about 8 hours 
spent 40 hours a week on it , i would invest more 
choice of photo editing is LightZone 
Wacon connects 
additional work was needed 
So , for you Linux fans 
this works 
this has helped 
's a slight learning curve 
Read all the reviews , there 's no more eraser 
Everything else works flawlessly 
it !!! 
got the medium 
Pen and Touch or the Intuos Draw -LRB- much cheaper 
spent the extra bucks 
currently use it

want something small so you can carry 
probably get the pro 
use Photoshop to pay 
get Intuos Art Pen and Touch to pay

All of the buttons work perfectly 
it is very aesthetically pleasing

Fantastic purchase The price was right recived it 
which as of course it should be 
clicker '' but this mouse and it 's myriad of buttons is helping me to stray a bit from my normal routine ... works seamlessly with WoW which as of course it should be ... very comfortable in the hand and the settings are accessible outside of and as well as in the game ... great service and as always ... i ordered the steel series merc keyboard 
mouse and it 's myriad of buttons is helping me to stray 
cool comes 
what I did 
buttons are perfectly placed 
mouse fits my hand nicely 
key bindings and integration to WOW is well done 
originally purchased this a bit hesitant 
that this mouse fits 
However , I really enjoy the way 
Works well and looks cool 
got this 
it fits perfect 
only complaint is the lightning bolts do not light 
picked that one 
picture just makes 
it look like they do 
Had good reviews 
loves it 
has everything 
it works well 
adjust the 
it fits comfortably 
how I played WoW with out it before 
it comes with it to set 
n't get the damn thing to work 
attached the mouse buttons 
buttons are spread 
Is my first gaming mouse 
Made the game much more enjoyable 
clicking the icons 
spend a lot more time 
playing my character than looking 
Ok , unlike the others reviewing here , I thought 
It has 11 buttons 
when using 3D programs 
It works great 
laser has basically died 
what spurred me to write 
that died 
update this 
which I did n't think 
really do not understand all 
die , just send it back 
replaced the steel series MMO cataclysm mouse 
n't have all the buttons 
mouse has less buttons 
It came 
recommend this product 
make a mouse 
that I owned previously 
craved more buttons 
previous 15-button version had buttons 
mouse reduces the button count 
Maybe Shaq 's fingers stretch 
that tightly integrate 
that still had a lot 
What we got 
utilize every button 
It is a solid win 
others I 've tried , I give this one a 5 star 
thibk it really is the best 
using this mouse 
bought the cataclysm mouse first 
who has big hands 
do gift 
buttons can easily be reached 
recommend it 
bought this mouse 
got it strictly for playing 
it comes 
bought another rechargeable 
it had a very annoying red infrared light 
that plugs 
use a 2.4 GHZ receiver 
most mice have 
unique design allows for smoothly pressing 
this should work for either hand very nicely 
one does n't have that typical curve 
that most have 
This also runs off 
charging cable 
that comes built-in 
recharge it when needed 
n't use the battery 
help it 
types of mice go to sleep 
state this will last about 18 months before it needs recharging depending on how much you use it , so we will see 
most people wo n't use this 
what it means 
cursor on your screen will move when you move 
This can be changed 
what it was made 
want a nice wireless mouse 
that just works 
This also makes 
that can be taken

This works 
have a basic security 
n't trust the RF link 
enter any manner 
It does n't feel cheap , however , if you like a heavier mouse go 
no setting up the Bluetooth 
it just plugs in 
buy more colors

why things are not working 
it read good to use 
exceeded my expectations 
it works good 
saw the speaker 
then bought it

hitting the keyboard 
barely hear my fingers

that works !!! 
finally I got one 
just have a very short reach 
use it 
that say 15 or 20 feet distance 
even though I 've bought some 
n't beat the price 
bought this to replace 
that I disliked because the keyboard was so bulky 
keyboard feels full/normal size to type on , including a 10-key number keypad -LRB- must-have for number cruncher / spreadsheet users -RRB- but without all the extra margin area above & below the keys , so it takes 
that is surprisingly missing 
keyboard has indicator lights 
others have mentioned 
it did n't take long to get used 
got it 
loves it 
now he can watch netflix on his TV while 
attached his computer 
leave the obnoxious computer 
not get keyboard 
had a another quiet combo keyboard/mouse some time ago 
set compares well 
playing video games 
not seen any drop 
Overall about 50-75 percent noise reduction compared to what i was using 
item arrived as expected 
duo met all 
keyboard would have standalone volume control 
Currently it requires two hands to press 
Otherwise , the keys have a nice tactile feel 
plug it back in to get 
get your fingers around it to pull 
offered me a full refund 
Due to the issues I 've had with the keyboard and mouse , the company contacted 
mouse has spectacular tracking capabilities 
So I read other reviews 
had this for about a month now 
have a multi-usb connector 
that has on/off features 
computer stays 
fingers get used 
Wife works night shift 
have long fingers as I do , I would recommend this 
company has great customer service 
good my wife had to have 
click the mouse you ca n't even hear it 
it will cause it to click 
click their keyboard and mouse all night keeping 
click '' is a bit sensitive 
received my new Jelly Comb keyboard 
how it is done 
ordered the product 
using it 
wife loves it 
it works well 
Also , my wife says 
It 's really meet my expectations 
n't had any problems so far 
mouse works perfectly 
that I would recommend 
keyboard and mouse are very quite just like the description promises 
that does not make loud clicking noises 
ordered two 
set Anker CB310 Full-Size Ergonomic Wireless Keyboard 
keys stick so it 's useless 
n't have anything 
review will help those 
had no issues with this so far 
Meets my needs well 
eliminated a lot 
cursor was moving the mouse 
Just what I wanted 
just install the batteries 
need 2 AAA batteries 
using it 
keyboard makes a little bit 
wife about 10 feet away did not even know when I would type 
complaining about battery life of the keyboard saying it only lasted 24 hours , they must have a defective unit because I put 
it only lasted 24 hours 
's no off switch 
that does n't bother me since I never bothered 
it has n't bothered me much 
definitely recommend it 
Good product , works great !!! 
exactly what I was looking 
Hubby loves this 
only using up one USB port 
having no wires 
it was an easy set 
purchased these items 
had no problems what so ever 
pieces use 1 `` AA '' battery 
keyboard uses 2 `` AAA '' batteries 
actually the mouse uses 1 `` AA '' battery 
However - the directions say 
Package arrived 
clicking the mouse 
combo are both very well built and VERY quiet when pressing 
just install the batteries 
Easy to use 
Currently I 'm using it 
it 's working perfectly 
update this review at later time to comment 
stating the battery life 
recommend it 
who absolutely hates the clicking sounds 
brought the feel 
far , it works fine 
it certainly is not possibly their set up made their mouse slow 
Someone said 
put 2 coats of clear polish on the keys to try 
updating my original review 
problem with the mouse not staying 
now that I 've used it 
takes a light touch 
replace old equipment 
buy this product again to give 
couple of people complain 
had no issues 
bought this 
Just add batteries 
got it 
issue resolved 
leftside shift button is cut 
keys on the keyboard are set 
it has a function button next 
used to it , it works fantastic 
Keyboard and mouse have a good feel 
has a sleep feature 
mouse does not have an on/off switch 
who uses the left shift key 
this is proving to be very annoying 
updating this because Jelly Comb Direct service is excellent 
only used this key board 
life does n't seem like it will be a problem 
this will compare 
that matches the mouse 
n't fault it for it , when it comes 
that fit 
have long fingers 
never found gloves 
everything works 
Glad I bought it 
not needed any Customer Service 
received an e-mail ` just in case you need 
it has been doing fine 
LOVE everything 
limiting my movements 
cluttering my desk

Son loved it

son loves it 
's face it not all people 
what some are complain about when it comes 
n't have a click 
still feel the click when I press 
that has a quite click 
that really counts 
had mice 
that click 
preform no better or worse then this mouse 
again I ask why all the bad reviews 
it is only intended to be an entry level gaming mouse 
extra buttons are backwards on this mouse as compared to it , why this is makes no sense to me considering 
bought this one to replace 
mouse as with Tech Net and others are all easily seen as being made 
speed it up you use 
back side button flips 
Example the Dpi buttons this mouse to lower 
front button takes 
take off a star 
that happens 
's face it 
it just makes it hard to teach 
n't mind it 
This has 
destroy it somehow I will definitely buy another 
only had it for a day so far 
build quality 
Ca n't beat the price either 
use it 
Makes virtually no sound when clicking

removing and reinserting the USB dongle 
It simply wo n't respond 
red light still illuminates on the mouse when I turn

turn it on to see 
it would just eat batteries quicker

it looked pretty cool 
rated it after a week of use , I would 've given it five stars 
Fits my needs 
how it only uses one AA battery 
it automatically turns the mouse 
it turns right back

Highly recommend it 
use it 
Oil from your hand may have gotten between the rubber `` tire '' and the plastic wheel , causing 
clean it , you must take it apart .1 
Remove the battery cover 
Carefully peel off the two black stickers by the battery compartment to reveal 
Remove the screws .4 
Carefully pull the black and red shells apart by holding 
sliding the black shell 
Unplug the wires 
Push the rubber tire 
Use a dry cloth to wipe

Wow made my day when i saw

playing games 
spamming buttons 
No click click

it looks cool 
mouse accomplishes the 2 things 
that I wanted 
bought it 
loves it 
when moving the mouse 
Fits my hand 
Works well and the price beats everything 
just pull the trigger 
it is not making any sounds 
which makes this mouse even more fun 
lights are shinning 
need 1 AA battery 
recommend it 
needed a wireless mouse so I looked 
wife recently got a laptop 
got it 
It has n't broken 
it has a slot 
now without annoying my roommate 
When I first got it 
picked and received this item , his sister wanted it badly 
use it on different platforms , PC and MAC both 
it works flawless 
n't expecting the mouse 
surprised that the packaging was actually decently fancy , it made 
using it 
however the side buttons sound 
Pros : - Extremely quiet - Many features -LRB- DPI switching/Side buttons -RRB- - Extremely portable -LRB- There is a place under the mouse the put the dongle in the mouse so you do n't lose it -RRB- - Looks great like a high tier mouseCons : - I kind 
put the dongle in the mouse so you do n't lose 
looking for a very affordable that looks and performs great , I would highly recommend this 
that looks and performs great 
break this or lose it , I 'll definitely buy it again 
lose it 
it clicked so dang 
bought this mouse 
boy did it surprise 
expected the mouse to work 
when that monitor goes to sleep so does 
dongle plugged 
Shortly after that the mouse goes to sleep 
wake the mouse 
it fires right up 
all you have to do is push a button 
it does actually work a dozen feet away 
how it avoids interference 
analyzer says 
best feature yet is actually what a gaming website obsessed 
's only one 
mouse will not work 
Rechargeable batteries may have 
difficulty working reliably in this due to the nominal voltage of 1.2 V Alkaline and primary 1.5 V lithiums work great though 
using an energiser 1.5 v lithium cell 
one I am using has sat 
leaving the led light 
son seems very happy

it seems to work well , as he has n't said 
Enjoying the unit 
gaming build

It feels super nice 
recommend this mouse 
All of the buttons function perfectly

It fits my hand

It also has a power 
saving thing 
it will go 
All you have to do is click the button 
it comes right back on

bought several Anker products 
currently using the product as I write 
It works perfectly 
Just what I needed 
it needs to be 
:-RRB- The mouse seems a bit bulkier 
product is working very well 
buttons at the top of the keyboard are not designed to be soft 
include the volume buttons 
play function buttons 
reverse their function 
which did not seem to be as responsive even after changing batteries inn 
not had a single issue 
now been using the mouse 
All of the buttons still work great , the mouse is smooth

rate keeps 
files included 
highly recommend this if you are looking 
Has very nice touch 
owned these

This reminds 
that finally died 
this lasts me as long 
always used Logitech before 
last keyboard/mouse wore 
which works great 
touch of the keyboard took a little getting used 
now that I 've used it 
sometimes hit extra keys 
that gets less 
have a heavy touch 
bought this keyboard/mouse because I was already familiar 
name has become synonymous 
gave me free stuff 
just spent enough time with Anker products to have developed 
Nobody paid 
see their name on a list of products , it 's definitely getting a second look 
Ordered this 
tried it 
all seems good 
system restart 
Initial setup needed 
Had previous good experience 
Also it has a 18month warranty 
Ca n't wait till Amazon has

keyboard is constructed , and , the mouse 
highly recommend this product 
that I may need 
make one criticism , it would be 
which results in unintentionally pushing 
fast shipping and items work really well 
not had any technical issues 
i can say 
keyboard has very useful keys at the top as well 
coworker says when I type 
it sounds 
harsh click 
computer immediately recognized it 
Keyboard has a nice feel 
that can advance/reverse the page -LRB- s 
where the thumb usually rests 
It took me a while 
accidentally click one 
it would take me to another page altogether 
who do lots of typing like I do 
that feels very good 
who responded to my question asking 
minutes during various meetings and a regular keyboard just makes too much noise 
found this keyboard to be very quiet 
ordered this because windows 10 does not like 
everything would just quit 
this delivered 
it impressed me right 
using it 
Glad I got it 
Updating ReviewI 've amended my previous review 
old Anker reached 
sent out a new set 
using it 
verifying my information 
updated my review 
first mouse had a slight delay in response time when clicking 
new mouse has experienced no delay in the days I 've been using 
who receives the faulty device its frustrating 
someone has to be that person 
handling it 
Anker admitted 
other companies have 
buying Anker products again 
Highly recommend the product 
Mouse died 
this set 
replacing the battery 
cleaning it 
worked or got the mouse to work 
keyboard still works 
Recommend a different model/piece 
Keyboard also feels good when 
keyboard still works 
parts lasted 
months in -LRB- something I should n't have to be happy 
portion of set died 
dying so early its just not worth the cost 
mouse died 
get a major brand 
which does n't have that issue 
NOT recommend this item

has a great battery life so far 
use one 
i 've every had 
quiet took a little getting used 
it really does make a difference 
Hated those gel ones 
buy it again 
that I have owned 
used one 
mouse has some weight 
not had any issues 
use this keyboard 
needed a new keyboard 
keyboard will use one AAA battery , and the mouse will use 
keyboard and mouse is aesthetically pleasing 
longer need a mouse pad 
Worked great , right 
just follow the 3 simple step instructions 
Add batteries 
Connect the USB receiver 
using this 
Wait a couple 
running Windows 10 OS 
driver installs automatically andWhoo-lah 
really like how lightweight the keyboard is as well as how the keys feel 
nice as the day I got it 
work and do their job 
mouse reprograms 
it does n't take up my whole desk 
this set 
it will stop working 
wheel has been acting 
it works great 
had it 
have no issues or problems to complain 
legs break way 
awesome customer service people sent me a whole new set 
found it to be less 
first review said 
uses a lot 
It drops key strokes 
not recommend this product 
this , when I posted this negative review on Amazon , I received an email from them saying 
received the replacement 
it is working perfectly 
It turned my opinion 
Exceeded my expectations 
did a little research 
This seemed to be 
what I was looking 
it really met my needs 
that says it 
Use it 
it works anywhere 
Wife works nights 
made additional Anker purchases since that are of equal quality 
n't change a thing 
Mouse fits great 
Product is exactly as it is described 
n't been sent the USB 
when I got the replacement 
returned this the first time because I thought 
combo uses one AAA and one AA battery instead 
purchased this 
had to rate this item , I would give the mouse a 4 star as it could fit 
dont use 
yr old can do it 
had this for 10 days now 
Quiet keys , nice wrist-rest and the mouse has a back-space clicker 
which I 've never seen 
which makes it fun 
rubbery tread 
n't find the transmitter 
answered my dumb question 
pull it 
Just pinch that 
received this 
wait a few minutes 
just add batteries 
unplug the mini USB 
tried three other key boards before deciding 
only had the product 
Used this 
not use this 
it should last just fine 
keys -LRB- set far back from the edge of the computer to accommodate the mouse -RRB- really inhibits speed 
causes wrist strain 
Laptops are made 
then purchased this keyboard 
So I bought a riser 
place the laptop 
really makes a difference 
those who are familiar with how to set them up would have no trouble 
getting it to work 
It took me a while to figure 
plugged into your laptop , it sets 
gets my full recommendation 
initially bought this keyboard 
it is still working great 
used this product 
who is looking 
looking a decent keyboard 
purchased several Logitech 
use CTRL 
experienced plastic key failures in those products because the plastic is too soft 
keys wore 
Keyboard solved the plastic problem 
that is plugged into the USB port since both devices experience 
attributed this 
moving the sensor to various USB ports on my computer and monitors , the problem disappeared after connecting 
purchasing more 
not beat the price 
purchased it 
also have a similar Logitech model 
mouse has a sensitivity adjustment 
had no problems 
use this

When I put the battery in -LRB- 1 AA positive to front -RRB- and turned on the lights flashed

It has substantial weight so it wo n't run 
it turned on and not drain the battery 
lights wo n't work when the computer is 
It had some burs 
Mine actually came 
when power is applied

It will make

price , it delights wonderfully

Just what my son needed 
's no better mouse out there 
using it 
Highly recommend seller 
why Apple discontinued these 
tried the Magic Mouse 
it does n't work 
experts say 
mice are n't going anywhere 
seller shipped quickly 
mouse make using 
mouse has received a lot 
it continue to function 
appreciate the lack 
has those wonderful `` touch '' features 
having no wire 
where my working hand is operating 
Freeing up a USB port 
really do dig my new -LRB- slightly used -RRB- Apple Mighty Mouse 
move my fingers around 
mouse , however , with its roller ball and side buttons , gives me total control 
Fits my hand better 
use one 
ball gets gunked up sometimes 
found two-button PC mouses 
turning off the functions 
use it 
When Apple came 
n't use touch screen computers 
bought a wired one 
n't find any new ones 
it was quite expensive!eventually found a used one 
side buttons allow me to switch 
original mouse has just begun to wear 
had my mac 
recomend it 
Apple has discontinued this model 
do a lot 
it gets 
work done 
configure the mouse easily 
use it 
n't have any need 
Glad i bought this cause 
it worked perfectly 
Have had wireless mouses , not bluetooth so when I saw 
just picked up my new Mac Mini 
Connected the mighty mouse 
Apple makes something 
it is not discontinued 
allow orbital/diagonal scrolling 
TACTILE scrolling responsiveness 
get better DPI sensitivity 
lacking that 
keep that little rubber ball CLEAN 
then pick your nose 
expect that little guy to survive 
It 's working well after we learned 
how to `` discover '' a new mouse 
Mouse has stood the test 
which , as you know , give 
has its benefits , Apple made a faux-pas when they eliminated 
showing every open window 
Magic Mouse CAN do this 
purchased 6 
have 2 extras 
what I mean straight away 
how to set up the wireless mouse 
contacted them , they answered my questions 
paired it 
positioning my hands 
now have lots 
that does not require any USB receiver 
It takes 2 AA batteries 
scrolling works a smidge different 
that requires a lot 
getting use too 
discontinued the mighty mouse 
highly recommend it 
that show all open apps 
not seen such great dedication 
how the mouse acted , without even a second 
seller sent me another one 
it works perfectly 
it looks 
brand new you ca n't tell it was ever used 
MightyMouse arrived exactly on time , Just as described 
definitely order form 
n't tell it 
hate the Magic Mouse 
just ca n't get it to work 
purchased this older bluetooth mouse to use 
prefer this mouse 
have much better control 
mouse came packaged 
which seems to me to be super sensitive 
not hurt my wrist 
prefer this 
tried quite a few mice 
that come close 
use this with my Dell XPS !! 
downloaded a driver 
Check the Magic mouse questions and answers on Apple website to find 
operate my computer 
connect my mac 
just do n't drop it 
where you turn it 
change batteries 
love the feature where you turn it off and it also gives you time to change batteries , I recommend rechargables yet it gives 
it also gives you time 
it will let 
one I got was shipped 
n't even need any 
put the batteries 
found the mouse 
that gets annoyed using 
using a laptop 
A must have 
It has a slight learning curve 
other mice will do that 
MM will access a lot 
Good battery life , can use one or two batteries 
comparing it 
finish are excellent 
it came in black to match 
bought one 
i still use the keyboard 
long time ago i was using a Microsoft keyboard and mouse duo and i still use the keyboard because of the nice shortcut keys bur the mouse does n't compare 
bur the mouse 
tracing is super quick i 
i was using a Microsoft keyboard 
bought this to replace my wired mighty mouse because I have 
it only has 2 usb ports 
bluetooth works just fine 
it makes 
Just turn it 
turning it upside down 
it pair up quick 
technology works great 
scroller works 360 degrees 
page can scroll 
do it 
when you click the center ball 
it takes me directly 
change this to go 
have open comes 
n't used this option much because I do n't really need 
Amazon shipped it to me very quickly 
learn something new to play 
It functions beautifully 
track-pad made certain PhotoShop fuctions difficult 
left and right buttons 
n't had anty problems 
definately recommend this mouse 
ever owned period 
n't got any issues 
Apple has amazed me one more time 
It works 
n't had it long enough 
Loved it 
longer use it 
this only had four stars 
usually do not write reviews 
who is blown 
that most other wireless mouses stick 
it tells if I am clicking 
chose it to be a hotkey 
also use the scroll wheel in conjunction with the command key to zoom 
Buttons - They take some getting use to because you have probably never experienced them before but they are a great extra set 
only find one 
thats all 
It holds two 
it can run 
it takes 30 seconds for it to reconnect 
saw some review 
that says 
turn it 
turning your computer on again , just turn the mouse 
have a MBP 2.2 Ghz 2GB RAM so my boot up is as fast as anyones but the mouse is still ready 
log in screen comes 
Now , when the connection is broken by moving the laptop too far away , then it will have to reconnect 
it takes no longer 
adjust this mouse to fit 
also change the double click speed if you want 
change the function 
Remember guys 
getting something good 
Making my mouse wireless 
use my mouse far from my computer with worrying 
only if I can get my cat to stop 
had my mighty mouse 
had no problems 
use it regularly 
design syncs very quickly now only taking 
recommend this mouse 
had high expectations 
buy one 
Most of the reviews I read set my expectation high 
have this mouse 
who uses the mouse the most is extremely pleased 
additional functionality is much welcomed 
take the plunge 
it would n't fit my hand 
Looking at the Mighty Mouse online , I got the impression 
also read reviews 
that the right click 
it had shortcomings mechanically 
that tries to fill 
only bought one for my wife instead of buying 
perhaps those reviewers did n't enable the feature 
click works great 
other mouses , it feels like there is 
even though it has a lower profile 
highly recommend it 
use it 
replace the batteries 
just keep it 
turn it 
only turn it off when I am gone 
It did loose its connection with my laptop once 
It just took a couple of minutes to reinstall 
it has not acted up again 
It has a great feel 
clicking action and scrolling -LRB- or click -RRB- action by the little roller ball on top provide great control 
It is well designed 
Mouse has everything 
that I need on a mouse an more 
PowerBook and this mouse has greatly improved my computer experience 
Ok , I have 
trackpad becomes cumbersome 
most can agree 
far , I 've had no issues 
which you need 
not updated my computer 
did this just so 
use the wireless tech 
have OSX 
who have experience 
it had any design flaws -- until you switch 
much of a major difference those minor details make 
use it 
that really make the difference :1 
tried many -RRB- 2 
makes a huge difference 
window scrolling 
other mouse has it -LRB- except the wired version of this mouse -RRB- 4 
So many `` portable '' mice lack this no-brainer feature6 
Wired mice eventually get tangled 
mice get gummed 
Other wireless mice experience dropouts 
that you can program 
Most mice have tons 
do your work 
mouse works perfectly 
spending less time switching 
mouse shines brilliantly 
which works very well 
use a laptop 
need the option of a mouse , because no pointing device built in to any laptop of any brand is as efficient 
Wired mice or mice with dongles add friction to your experience so you often just end up not bothering to set them up , rendering 
mice suck 
have pathetic battery life 
require a charger 
most full-sized mice either -LRB- a -RRB- do n't have an off switch 
require a dongle 
None of these problems plauge this mouse 
convinced you yet that this mouse has tiny details which make big differences , consider this 
mouse have an off-switch 
off-switch covers the laser optics in the off position , making 
mouse has tiny details 
throw it 
which make big differences 
takes 3 seconds to setup or tear down , you 'll use it 
takes 30 seconds , you 'll use the laptop trackpad , making 
capability allows USB ports to remain 
Easy to install 
just put it in an old athletic sock -LRB- washed , of course -RRB- so that it does n't get scratched 
mouse travels easily 
liked the original -LRB- wired -RRB- Mighty Mouse 
new Mighty Mouse has a much better scroll wheel 
BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL MIGHTY MOUSE -- I liked the original -LRB- wired -RRB- Mighty Mouse , but many of the buttons were difficult to use -- the scroll wheel had a tight grip 
that let 's 
n't stand mouses 
press the wrong button here 
that are filled 
button will designate what function 
BUTTONS -- I ca n't stand mouses like the Logitech ones that are filled with so many buttons , that you basically ca n't help but to press the wrong button here and there -- the Mighty Mouse has an excellent set 
often do not use bluetooth mouses 
tracking really does feel like a solid wired mouse , making 
Apple really invested a lot of good engineering into making 
mouse ca n't keep 
it does n't seem to work 
PUCK -- personally , I miss the hockey puck mouse 
bought this duo to do 
it feels great 
Item just as described , mouse has a very nice feel 
Great set 
husband loves it 
instructions included 
Lights work 
old son loves it 
Unfortunately one of our clumsy dogs knocked it 
It no longer spins 
It glides 
that looks 
it works fine 
had trouble 
getting the computer to read 
once it did 
paid $ 12 
It takes 2 AAA batteries 
received lots 
It arrived quickly 
It is NOT meant to be that 
price , it delights wonderfully 
an can break easily 
bought 6

rocking logitech 
mouse has a few extra buttons 
using it 
used a wide variety 
more of a general balance feel 
far , I have had this mouse 
never had any problems 
mouse , had the same model 
doing a great job 
when it comes 
one and i must say 
It fit my hand so well 
Logitech also has some pretty good support so you cant 
that I have ever used 
using it for about 3 years now 
many others I try 
it a year later , works 
only accept another mx518 
ever find it 
It does n't click loudly 
which as I understand it , actually changes the DPI 
It has built 
n't have any problems 
n't use anything else 
that broke 
bought this mouse because it is the upgraded model 
that switch the mouse sensitivity 
it wo n't last me another two 
have large hands 
has no signs 
n't had issues 
complaints at all , would n't trade it 
design of the mouse does not change 
paying the company more 
Used the MX series 
page forward button could maybe be pulled back a few millimeters 
changing the dpi sensitivity 
it feels great 
use this to play 
which replaced my MX510 back 
It works perfectly 
Logitech continues to make 
none of them fit my hand perfectly 
tried other mice 
had this mouse for about a year and 3 months now 
it came 
just as well as it did 
claw grip 
provides a solid grip 
's a ridge 
had this 
signs of wear besides the G logo on top is chipping away slightly 
high-traffic areas like the palm and left mouse button areas have immaculate printing 
left mouse button areas 
This means durability 
Software offers a lot 
set up different customizations for each game , etc etc. 
only takes up 20 mb 
mostly use it 
these came 
still have this 
highly recommend this mouse 
mouse going back 
Great for all your FPS needs 
recently got a G500 
found this particular model of the G400 to be the best 
used the G100 
has a nice grip 
also have a G Mat cloth mouse pad 
mouse feels good 
play various games such as Diablo 3 , Fallout 3 , Borderlands 2 etc and this mouse pairs up 
mouse moves very slowly 
once you install the Logitech software 
mouse really shines 
Logitech brings back this form factor 
Tried many 
place more value 
static configuration provides 
provides enough contour 
change DPI 
It is coated 
that provides a good amount of grip without giving 
Overall , I would highly recommend this reboot 
other mice on the market seem a bit gimmicky when it comes 
This is about as advanced as a mouse needs 
that fits your hand well 
Youtuber recommended this mouse 
did some research 
still using it 
recommend this mouse 
FPS ever .2 -RRB- build quality better 
moves mouse occasionally 
Has the same shape 
miss your 518 , buy one 
newest Logitech mice do n't feel good 
logitech makes high quality products 
using this 
yet to discover a single downside 
took my time before making 
Had it 
Get one if you can 
needing a new mouse 
n't find one 
that would fit my needs 
not have connectivity issues 
now be using it 
G400s is built perfectly 
It still fits my hand great 
hyperglide skates 
Fits my hand exactly the same 
use the mouse without having loaded 
This means 
n't get the exact same default sensitivities 
fix that 
software might let 
use this mouse 
it worries me slightly 
Used it 
bought bottom 
never knew the true pleasure 
look at me now , Ma!I loved this mouse 
paid some months back 
ergonomically fits my hands pretty much perfectly 
n't have particularly large hands 
personally use a kinda 
natural grip has since moved to accommodate 
that is used to assign 
definitely buy another!Also 
bought this after my trusty Razer Deathadder started 
that is commonly known 
lot of research and a lot of opinions point to this mouse being the best 
use a palm grip 
own 4 
i have this exact mouse 
even bring one with me to work 
Bought the first one 
G400 has the same proven shape 
n't give you sweaty hands 
buttons have a solid pressure point 
adjustment works flawlessly 
prefer PVC coated cable before nylon braded 
couple different gaming mice , mostly razer products such as the deathadder 2013 -LRB- < - WORST mouse in existence -RRB- and none of them came close to feeling as good 
have literally no problems 
use this mouse mostly for playing 
emptying the clip 
clicks on the mouse are a little sensitive 
playing only league 
Put it 
Great gaming mouse especially if you have smaller hands 
using it right now 
using this mouse right now 
getting a mouse 
switch resistances 
it makes a huge impact when doing 
works fine 
have no complaints 
purchased a SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad to pair with it because otherwise the mouse would skip 
having an optical gaming mouse without having 
Used an MX518 
one sold 
G400s uses different software 
518 did 
does everything 
miss the smooth texture feel of the 518 though 
marketed as an FPS gaming mouse , this is an easy recommend 
Buttons rated 
mouse would last another 50 
mouse is used 
Deep thumb groove means 
Fits natural curve 
This likely wo n't matter to you unless you happen 
buttons near the scroll wheel need the Logitech software to be mapped 
productivity does n't go up relative 
styling will be hit 
say , `` function 
get all the office functions of this mouse for $ 30 if you need 
resist sweaty palms 
mouse comes 
many people do n't care 
it works well 
mouse works 
need a rubber or satin feel to your mouse , seek therapy immediately 
that goes `` fwap fwap 
nobody wants a mouse cord 
it appears identical 
it seems 
it works 
some would n't even notice 
That said 
it will outlast the USB port concept 
glide pads on the bottom have been made larger 
it glide more smoothly 
which makes 
that peels 
's a nice slightly rough and easily grippable non-slip surface 
texture of the grip surfaces has also been improved 
it replaced 
that you want if you 're a gamer 
Replaced my G400 
Great mouse and delivery -LRB- to Sweden -RRB- went smooth 
It fits in my hand great 
Has the same feel 
mouse has increased my accuracy in FPS games by a mile , way better 
mat also contributed 
mouse works perfectly 
buttons are easily assigned and most importantly 
MOUSE WORKS GREAT 
replaced it 
last logitech mx500 lasted yeeears 
Bought this mouse , was delivered in 23 hours , my life 
Logitech , I buy your products 
Has zero acceleration/prediction 
that preceded it 
configure settings 
both are working very well 
need a mouse 
that will respond 
used the MX518 for many years -LRB- and a brief time with the G500 that I 'd rather forget -RRB- , the style and fit of the G400s is exactly what I was looking 
that I 'd rather forget 
use 800dpi 
wheel has a bit more resistance 
register scrolling when you 're not pushing 
ever had an old mouse start 
mouse itself glides like it 's 
What can I say 
n't hurt my hand 
518 died 
Solid mouse , excellent drivers under both Windows 7 and 8.1 and it works great 
which had fraying cables 
really loved the grip 
prefer it 
n't had any tracking problems 
exactly what you would expect 
use it 
This has done quite well 
Kobe tits 
Have had 
Great mouse 10/10 would recommend 
i could get the exact same thing 
n't cutting it 
It has been working 
Just what my gamer MIT graduate wanted 
i 'm talking hundreds 
using it now 
that is perfectly suited 
have average size hands 
Most buttons are conveniently placed 
not caused issues 
Mouse works well on other machines also 
it could somehow make it to where I could totally own 
that would have made this mouse 
it has served me well too!Looking 
also currently own the G500 Laser Gaming Mouse 
It has zero friction and scrolls too fast 
series have `` notchy 
which it makes it easier to control 
it has been said 
which I tend to agree 
own any mouse 
it had perfect weigh 
Took a while 
owned this mouse for over a year now 
mouse fits 
hydrophobic coating really does do its job 
Why it has since been replaced by a newer model the G402 
It feels very durable 
recommend !! 
It has a very good sensor too 
liked the 518 
still set it at 800dpi if you prefer 
518 had something spilled in it so needed 
still have my 510 
bought this to replace 
that said 
it feels 
have slight acceleration 
digitizer does n't seem to be 100 % 
buy many more of these as my other mice wear 
Best mouse ever made 
It has such a great weight 
It has huge range 
own these 
performance please 
search the benchmark 
never had a problem 
forking out big money 
buy 3 top-of-the line gaming mice 
has the most comfortable maneuverability 
It seems ridiculous 
one fits my large hands the best 
that has no predictive interpolation 
mostly play Counter Strike 
read more information on the internet and on different forums about it to find 
literally use this mouse 
have absolutely zero discomfort 
It offers perfect location 
mouse is made 
took in feedback from its previous generation gaming mice to offer 
questions asked 
mouse looks very durable 
it should last a long time 
It 's going to be pretty hard 
Moves cursor 
Quality strides , no phantom clicks or double clicks , scroll mouse gives you solid clicks 
excellent responsiveness , had to get 
last one lasted about 6 years 
owned a MX510 
reading some reviews 
Solid mouse for the price except shipping took 
someone rode their bike 
ever owned and I 'm a avid if not more gamer 
mouse performs flawlessly 
use a Glock Armorers mat 
it worked fine 
mouse continued to perform 
exactly what you 'd expect 
that sits really well 
really do n't use the extra buttons 
which had a very similar form factor 
use it 90 % 
always used gaming mice for productivity because I find 
which has become more important to me recently 
that I own 
experienced this you 'll understand 
hopefully increasing the lifespan 
Logitech moved 
increasing the switch durability 2.5 x 
which lasted me a good 10 years 
need a mouse 
's no way 
definitely buy this mouse again 
Logitech never lets 
what they stopped selling 
bought 1 billion dollars worth of Logitech at Retail price , Logitech STILL would not give decent customer/technical support 
bought 1 trillion dollars worth of Logitech products at full retail ... NOPE 
still would not give a good wadsham 
not give a duck if you paid 
Giving a damn 
Logitech does not give a flying duck 
Few do 
husband loves this 
bought a second one to use 
bought this after buying 
have bigger hands 
Not to mention the performance 
EDITunfortunately after a few days the left click started to stick 
i think 
It feels just like 
that does n't bother 
buy another 
probably never purchase another mouse , if in a few years this one goes 
used a MX518 
Tried other brands 
G400 feels great 
mouse but Logitech sucks now 
n't make that mouse so I 'm stuck 
have 4 non working or nasty MX518 
That sucks 
got it 
previous one lasted 
that had the fake dents 
older style that had the fake dents in it -RRB- Still performs much better 
i loved the MX518 
i tried very hard to find 
purchashed two high end gaming mouses 
using this 
that gets damaged 
had no problems 
Screw those MMO mice , you do n't need a million buttons 
This feels great 
G400s provide much better software support 
use this one at the office since I am on the computer 
bought my son one 
Mine worked so well 
which I enjoyed a lot 
works the same 
it felt great 
It has a perfect grip , the perfect 4000dpi sensor 
teal and painted decals do n't really suit it 
it seems 
rather it look just like it 's predcessor 
debating between wired and wireless , please take my advice 
has the response time 
when you need it to work 
also avoid the inevitable low battery right 
use a few more programmable buttons 
more or less DPI is required 
overly complicated about it just a couple buttons 
that 's very well priced 
it had a braided cable 
buying one of there G series keyboards pretty soon 
have normal size hands 
use 800 , 1000 , and 1300 dpi 
recommend this 
who wants a gaming mouse 
has normal size hands 
far the g400 feels the exact same 
Had that 
cable got kinked 
it failed 
loved it 
got its replacement 
previously owned a G500 
ordered a Corsair M65 
when I got it 
acceleration felt really weird 
's an optical mouse 
's NO acceleration/funny business like there is 
options are now limited to optical mice only , because the technology is simply the most accurate 1:1 hand-to-mouse experience 
mouse has no gimmicks , no lights 
only had this mouse for about a month right now 
owned the precursor 
found this one on sale so I got 
bought this mouse because I was looking 
use this new G400s 
which is still going strong 
moved my old MX 
using this style mouse 
highly recommend it 
also get Logitech 's configuration software 
set different profiles 
only used it to tweak 
rebind the mouse buttons and set different profiles for your mouse for use with different games if you 're into that sort 
played hours 
replace my items if they are broken 
have AWESOME customer support 
losing connection 
i 've used every mouse 
logitech will always have my business 
fits almost anyone 's hands 
highly recommend this product 
programming the buttons 
it seems 
use the mouse 
boyfriend loves the mouse 
it works perfectly 
this does n't have LED 's because a lot of mice , the LED 's do n't shut 
playing a game 
browsing the internet 
That has to be my favorite part 
Logitech will let 
customize the buttons 
lot of the games I play let 
action to go 
running etc. 
used the thumb button 
Also , the material of the mouse feels really nice 
lot of people like mice to fit their hands , so hopefully that helps 
fit their hands 
had it 
it exceeded my expectations 
changed the sensitivity 
pay more 
keep it 
where you have slack 
lost many gaming mice like this one by accidentally yanking 
actually the two side buttons seem to be placed 
mapped my chat programs ' `` push 
software seems adequate 
highly recommend this mouse for it 's responsiveness 
had the older version 
purchased another brand to try 
that lasted 
cat chewed the cord 
Even got it to play 
semi claw 
semi palm grip 
get one if you havent 
i would recommend some other brand 
's the reason 
many failed Razer products 
that I have used 
purchased this 
so this mouse had some big shoes 
liked the 510 
what I got to replace it , based on gaming forum reports 
that does the job 
Just plugged it in 
works fine 
buy this again 
far the mouse is working great 
n't need a mouse with a lot of programmable buttons than this mouse will work 
that you can download 
always loved logitech mice 
used a few 
bought this G400s 
it cause 
what can you expect 
used that 
it did n't totally meet my expectations 
Then I saw the G400s 
gaming needs 
It meets all my expectations 
perfectly so I hereby give this mouse a 5 star rating 
outdone yourselves again 
mouse works 
that has a keypad on the side if you play 
Later on you may want to opt 
browsing it 
just get a wired mouse 
It will make your life so much better 
purchased this product to replaced 
item replaces the MX518 Gaming Mouse 
It works well 
mouse was highly recommended 
got it 
adjusting the speed of the cursor when doing 
adjust the speed 
then set it back 
highly recommend it 
bit of plastic sticking 
luck and I can easily manage it 
set it up , Thanks 
that just wore 
replace an older version 
what I expected 
it would do 
it does 
used tons 
Razer and other brands ca n't compete 
It fits my style of play better 
have a g500 
snapping and acceleration are off by default 
other logitech mice have 
it also lacks the greivances 
mouse like this is required , not optional 
n't notice a difference 
play a lot 
use it with a Razer brand mouse bungee and a Steelseries QcK + 
bought this mouse because I wanted 
spend several hundred dollars 
had it 
purchased this mouse 
mouse-wheel was sometimes physically resist moving 
ends up lasting as long as the last one , I 'll have got my money 's worth 
recommend this mouse 
who could use the DPI settings 
bought this mouse about 8 months ago 
Logitech had modified the perfect ergonomics 
It has a bunch of new features while still retaining 
keeps dirt from collecting 
have a few complaints however 
cord looks really cheap 
it will be cut easily 
that have nice braided cables 
Offensive , and this mouse works perfectly 
wanted a fairly cheap , wired mouse 
that I can use 
highly recommend this mouse 
ago I found the perfect mouse 
Eventually it wore 
it was n't made any more 
that 's 
how it 's gone ever 
when I need a new mouse 
Logitech dropped the side 
using it for strafing 
buy a brand 
using Logitech gaming mice 
i 'd ever owned 
unfortunately it had a badly made cord 
has a fancy new paint job 
time will tell if it has 
cord looks the same 
that was starting to miss 
purchased this to replace 
one of the clicks did n't get `` sent 
had the G400s 
that seems to be caused 
clicking sound is accompanied 
button feels increasingly stiff 
not to mention the sound 
that does n't -LRB- yet -RRB- affect the function 
it just * feels * so wrong 
give it a few days 
perhaps it 's just ` breaking 
revise/update my review depending on the outcome 
using this mouse 
stiffness of the buttons has given way 
G500/G500s is touted 
it `` floats and tugs '' as you slide 
mass is not secure 
Also , the dual-mode scroll wheel does n't feel as precise when you switch 
have the adjustable weight feature of the G500s , all other aspects feel 
wheel feel more solid 
wheel lacks the left 
that just make 
texture of the mouse have a very nice soft feel 
son bought this 
LOVES it 
always use Logitech products for playing 
Purchased this to replace 
thing is rated 
last mouse did n't quite get past a few thousand so I chose 
When this mouse 's durability fails 
it 's still working 
that crapped out on me spectacularly 
bought this mouse a month ago 
mostly be comparing it to the DeathAdder since that 's the mouse 
bought this to replace 
PROS + Feels extremely well constructed 
External materials do n't attract grime 
Has some heft without being excessive 
has a great grip 
actually prefer mousewheels 
n't really fault the mouse itself for this though 
this has taken a little adjusting 
position felt naturally comfortable 
many others have said 
It ca n't be compared 
drivers seem excessively large 
complaints I have are minor and/or features I am still adjusting to , and I have n't run into any glaring defects worth 
which will last 
This definitely feels 
has no friction 
Product arrived 
purchased this 
that went 
not use the different pre-configured game settings 
just use the default 
adjust the game as necessary 
It fits nicely 
add just one thing to this , I would add two buttons 
it does 
what it is supposed 
that will operate 
Ca n't recommend it enough 
trusty MX518 finally breathed its last breath 
keep my placement about at 2000dpi so I did n't have 
good mouse , worth the coin , would buy again 
Great mouse , reminds me of my mx518 ... great 
change dpi 
buying another 
play games 
when friends or family come over 
Great mouse , feels great 
loves it 
son does a lot 
has great response when gaming 
using a qck 
that i got 
Super smooth 
almost like you have both your middle finger 
it looks 
hold causes all your fingers to be on the mouse 
none of them are dragging 
using this `` style 
passed it on to my nephew along with my pc when I built 
which I loved 
first owned a MX500 
finally just retired it 
then purchased a MX518 to go 
used the 518 
it 's looking a bit ratty 
it is still working 
where I rest my thumb 
finish is gone on all of the buttons and where I rest my thumb , ring , pinky fingers while gripping 
also the feet are worn 
Anyway , this mouse did n't disappoint , great tracking 
that I can detect 
it does feel a bit cheaper 
it feels great 
That said 
then auto revert 
owned this mouse 
Nothing has broken 
settings work 
had no wrist pains 
Has an ergonomic shape 
Back and Forward buttons do n't work 
that I 've owned it 
it feels better to me honestly 
this has to be the best mouse 
that require it 
MMB is n't well designed 
it began to suffer 
MX518 was already pretty well loved when I started 
that damages the internal wires 
problem can be traced back 
throw out the old one 
Works great - got 
Previously I 've own a R. A. T. 
mouse glides 
n't had any problems so far 
It feels durable 
wheel feels just right 
recommend it 
who needs a good gaming mouse 
play games 
mainly use it to play 
It has a great response time 
use either a claw or palm grip 
usually have the other buttons 
where it does n't fly 
It also has buttons 
increase or decrease the dpi 
highly highly recommend this mouse 
it does not look exactly like it does 
It works wonderfully , however 
It was shipped to me really quickly 
read a lot 
where persons heard a high-pitched electronic sound 
which makes them good 
which basically means 
G400 is meant 
which allow you to increase 
surfing the web 
it features interchangeable DPI 
had a Logitech G300 mouse 
bought this G400s 
contains all the things 
that is n't going to break 
having a serious mouse 
that really help 
has some features 
Now the mouse can zoom across great distances easily 
also map the Home/End keys 
This allows me to jump 
It does seem a little recessed 
looks are n't too loud 
Pros - Great form , feel 
cord seems very fragile 
some of the new mice have 
it had that 
push the little '' + '' to increase 
turn my sensitivity way 
it cut 
which I only stopped using because I gave 
also a lifelong Logitech convert 
i got this to replace 
it was still to slow 
DPI on my mx518 maxed 
things moves lighting fast 
that go 
It feels very durable 
used the previous iteration 
time to get a new mouse , i went straight back to this one since it is very accurate 
get a new mouse 
that really depends 
owned a couple 
tracking and sensitivity began to suffer 
It worked great 
what I could find 
com , to see 
carried an Amazon Prime Membership 
what they represent 
This was all after trying an E-3lue Mazer Type-R 
hits pahah 
G400s I found , purchased 
finding something 
what I was looking for 
packaging alone screams quality 
comes a significant cost as 
this could have saved me some money 
bought it 
what I can ascertain 
Logitech delivered 
Time will tell if the buttons hold up to a behemoth size 20 million clicks , but first impressions speak volumes with people , and I am confident this mouse from Logitech will deliver on its promises !! 
impressions speak volumes 
mouse from Logitech will deliver 
get it 
phase this mouse 
It seems 
~ GET IT WHILE IT 'S HOT 
always used Logitech items 
n't find the right drivers 
that I bought this one 
Been a fan 
gets the job 
Had an older Logitiech G400 
that gave 
it felt 
Got an Anker mouse first 
how my old mouse felt 
version has a better look 
feels the same 
button moves smoothly making 
husband uses it 
purchase and recommend it 
ever had the privilege 
heard something 
Whenever I 've heard something described as `` ergonomic , '' I would just think 
mouse seems more than capable 
feel any better 
that do n't perform any better 
liked a braided cord on the G400s , the lack of a braided cord does not detract 
heavier duty mouse cord could be implemented 
Logitech makes the best mice 
Almost seemed a shame 
throw it 
ease to use and accuracy settings make it all that much better 
saves you a lot 
wanted a sensitive mouse 
gave it 5 stars 
coating and grooves in the mouse makes 
it fit to my hand nicely 
have relatively small hands 
surfaces I use differ 
mouse has no issues 
loved my Mx518 
wanted a higher polling rate 
which involve some really precise aim 
play Battlefield 
mouse delivered where it counts 
n't break the bank 
it can read 
one has no issues 
use my laptop 
i hope 
i am running 
ever used it 
Gave this 
absolutely loves it 
gamer should have one as good 
play Counter Strike competitively 
mouse does everything right 
Everybody has a subjective view 
's no arguing 
mouse tracks beautifully 
kind of clicky-ness they want 
old G5 used to skip 
where the ring finger rests 
rest my finger 
wrap their finger 
do the same 
remove the silver detailing 
it looks less professional 
that came 
buying this mouse i used a generic hp mouse 
i had lying around 
used it 
that uses fingertip grip 
mouse does n't have a braided cable , if you 're into that sort 
Got this for my new adopted XIM Edge , it runs very smooth 
Many XIM Edge users recommend it 
old grandson wanted this 
really likes it 
which was starting to get 
opening it 
cleaning it 
cleaning did n't help much , so I figured 
n't need all those buttons 
n't play MMOs 
hopefully it will hold 
which I do n't use 
that I had to return 
518 being discontinued 
find the same feel and love here 
scheme looks nice 
bought this a gift 
mouse works 
Fits my hand comfortably 
Buttons have a nice feel 
additional software like my razer did 
adjustment built in to the mouse does n't require 
tried many mice 
It has a great ergonomic shape 
have the option 
that does not cramp my hand 
turn acceleration on if you please 
computer-illiterate 90-year-old grandmother could probably figure it 
use it 
never actually had a need to use it , therefore this is not much 
n't actually used the g400s yet -LRB- I have plugged it in to confirm that it is not a lemon -RRB- because my g400 is still in perfect working order 
plugged it in to confirm 
feel obliged to review the 400s as I really see no difference between the g400 and s models other than a new paint job , possibly materials 
who cares for me as I use 
when the time comes 
prefer it 
that I have used 
it feels more solid 
owned this 
Mousewheel has a bit of a different feel to it though , so it may take 
Logitech always provides high quality gear 
reliable mice and webcams that meet or exceed expectations!Nothing beats wired 
that meet or exceed expectations!Nothing beats 
spectrum is crowded enough 
using Logitech products 
Gets the job 
DPI and accuracy continues to be first rate 
Using this mouse 
avoid bloat 
Never used the Logitech software 
Using the mouse as-is 
received the mouse 
loves it 
also customize the buttons 
keys work well 
i would get again 
It has several different sensitivities 
has those two side buttons 
purchased this item 
i replaced my mx518 
son asked 
It has buttons 
apparently that helps 
Anyway - he 's been using it 
what feels good 
not used it long enough to comment 
it feels much more durable 
rubberized side rubbed 
actually that mouse fit me immediately 
have a friend 
that has the Razer DeathAdder 
style adjusted to it so it 's really comfortable 
However after using it 
bahhhh just numbers 
have a mousepad 
so who cares about lazer?Will update 
i bought this when my 2nd razer deathadder went 
sad how bad people are , they must not have this mouse 
Everything works great 
only thing I think would make it better is 
i would never get a `` gaming '' mouse 
thought i would never get a `` gaming '' mouse for who knows wen , I still do miss my ThermalTake Black gaming mouse 
mouse works great 
DPI had a led indicator 
who knows wen 
do programming 
say the normal use 
Really hits the mark with build 
tested both 
purchased 2 mice 
mouse felt great 
returned it 
tested the CM Storm Recon 
returned the CM Storm as 
got the Logitech G400s 
recommend it 
n't beat the price 
using it 
loves this mouse 
never purchased a proper `` gaming mouse 
always had the attitude 
started `` mis-clicking 
using this mouse 
wheel and buttons actually click 
wheel does n't `` float 
same amount of pressure is required 
which I never used 
it throws your aim 
this depends 
rest my palm 
previous two mice had to be covered 
that I can think 
requires hardly any effort 
Mouse has a smooth motion 
use the controls 
using old mouse 
returned it 
packed that 
Feels the exact same 
had a nifty graphic upgrade 
chose this item as I have had 
items for quite some time and my old mouse was no longer being made 
upgrade was needed 
item works just as good 
bought this mouse 
Nothing major , we are really just talking 
this could mean a lighter and more accessible mouse 
which will allow 
miss the MX518 's characteristic look 
had the earlier version 
which feels really nice 
G400s has some updated features 
new color matches my computer station 
that fits just right 
mouse reminds 
found it to be a little inaccurate 
product proved me wrong 
tried the G500 prior 
Logitech might be going downhill 
which are about normal sized 
It feels amazing 
it functions flawlessly 
Great mouse , fits great 
broken , do n't fix it 
get another 
recommend this mouse 
Logtiech is known 
5/5 would buy again 
hand get sweaty 
sometimes overanticipates movement 
have a med/large hand this mouse fits so well 
it keeps you from having 
give this mouse a shot 
gave a 1,000,000 star rating 
Mouse works fine great response time 
mouse would buy again if this mouse breaks 
customize the button functions 
that I loved 
wanted a replacement 
Found this 
Exactly what I wanted 
gaming is being limited by having 
that really fits your hand 
USB cord feels very weak 
positioning might be in a little awkward/uncomfortable position 
person has a preference 
optical will never fail 
switch the DPI on the fly without the software as 
n't need anything pricier 
comfartable go geate 
realy remind the mx500 
more words required 
what should i write 
includes downloadable key bindings 
also specify other applications/games by referencing 
launch the game 
then specify the key bindings 
Nothing else needs to be said 
really enjoying it 
never seen any appeal in the `` SUPER HAX0R GAMING MOUSE WITH 1337 BUTTONS !!!!!!! '' because I did n't need 
Which I use to switch 
bought this because it was simple 
yet had the stuff 
recommend this 
who wants a minimalistic mouse 
Nice quality gaming mouse , was exactly what I was looking 
have so many more programmable buttons 
used my MX518 
which feels nice 
sent gift 
just replaced my 7 year old MX518 
that fits my hand 
tried many other mice 
not replace this design 
It just works 
asked it to deal 
mouse feels comfortable 
used the g5

meet my needs 
recommend this mouse 
put my computer

texture takes 
some getting used to when going 
owned a mouse

It has the same feel 
that have 
i was looking 
many buttons i usually end up hitting 
it has the same general design 
i saw this mouse 
when it started going 
decided shell 
Well , they do n't produce it anymore , so after looking 
pads underneath the mouse now cover a larger surface area 
It glides fluidly 
It clicks effortlessly 
it comes 
It is satisfying to open 
it performs excellent 
replaced my mouse it works perfectly fine 
Last one was broken 
beating both Logitech

what you pay for 
had no problem 
car feels 
find the USB adapter 
Slide the black top backwards to insert 
that goes 
have a collection of these cheap mice so it will probably last 
that much but been using it 
cute and useful , lots of fun , my grandson loved it 
keeps it 
daughter just loves it 
that plugs 
having search 
where to install batteries 
how to find the usb piece 
mouse works perfect 
Worked well , kept me from having mouse paw ... ordered the wireless version 
using it 
it 's held up perfectly 
it feel awkward?Yes at first 
re-learning muscle memory 
Now I find it very comfortable 
selecting individual pixels 
's a lot less force 
something about the change in grip and pressure -LRB- there 's a lot less force on your fingertips with the vertical mouse , which is a good thing -RRB- causes a slight loss 
it really make 
difference?I 've personally felt a lot less cramping 
routinely work really long hours 
that my hand hurts 
That has n't happened nearly as much since I 've been using 
it 's definitely made things better 
fingertips extend well past the buttons and scroll wheel , so I 'm really clicking 
Maybe I have big hands 
left that 
took the base-plate off , the mouse felt much lighter 
taking that 
it snaps 
n't curl my finger comfortably 
hold the mouse 
moving your hand more 
need one 
use my mouse all day long 
it works well 
use it 
gave a 5 star for 
giving a 4 star 
how it helps carpel tunnel 
It causes the upper elbow area pain 
much relieves the wrist area 
Has a fast mouse ball part 
It has an Excellant grip 
hand to lay 
So yes I would 100 % recommend 
mouses plugged 
FYI trick 
pain diminished using 
buttons have a super nice light touch 
bought the Deluxe M618 
it delivered 
ordered the white and wired version 
it does not feel like it 's going 
which means 
build quality 
it does take 
guy and gamer i spend many hours 
some getting used to working 
that being said 
n't recommend gaming 
Gripping a vertical mouse 
It really takes 
that have not been used in your arm and wrist being utilized 
actually feel other muscles 
adjust mouse speed together 
it makes movement extremely fast 
it would make sense having 
n't even see the pointer 
i never see a need for more than 1600DPI because you can simply go 
that require such rapid movement 
how to adjust mouse speed 
that at full speed will require more 
have a game 
put my hand 
i was worried 
who have a problem 
mouse should really be deleted 
it stopped to work 
it is still working 
had a delux mouse 
evoluent is living more 
Easy to use 
had this mouse 
it turns 
use my mouse 
which requires a lot 
get one 
that I could use as an alternate when I needed 
wrist would feel better immediately while using 
found actual use difficult 
how to use this mouse 
used the mouse in its standard configuration , your hand and arm are completely disengaged 
mouse comes 
removed that piece , and with the base of my hand resting on my desk , I can now make the precise movements 
vertical mouse is becoming my primary mouse 
that I use 
mouse has saved my wrist 
using this mouse 
bought this because my wrist has started 
It has taken 
some getting used 
mainly giving it 
Some of the layout could be improved however 
still using this 
loving it 
have several people 
now wanting one 
wrist still has n't been hurting since using 
used to how it operates , it works well 
sometimes hit the DPI button 
just hit it twice more 
it feels 
other people wanting it once they see 
Amazon had the gel cover 
that has helped me immensely 
still have no further wrist pain 
Easy to use 
adjust the mouse sensitivity 
bought and ergonomic keyboard 
pain went away 
It does take a few hours to get 
recommend it 
press the keys phalanx 
Thus work different muscle groups 
many here I had some RSI 
alternating hands 
thought this mouse might not be fantastic because it is only able to be used in the right hand , however i have less pain 
battery has lasted 6 months so far 
set works perfect 
see the keyboard without turning 
it works great 
n't take up much space 
recommend it 
it eliminates wrist drag 
Just received the unit 
keys feel good 
keyboard hooks up real quick 
n't hear a thing 
just ordered this keyboard 
edit videos

n't have the heavy price tag 
mouse and keyboard feel

other keyboards small enough to fit in my laptop bag do not have a numeric keypad 
it came 
It makes working 
Fits perfectly with any white/silver themed electronics

What I mean 
move it 
only touch it 
once I embraced the size 
made contact 
things got really nice 
awesome , feels great 
how this mouse is sold so cheap 
just buy this thing 
detect it , just run the device 's troubleshooter 
using it 
n't have very large hands 
it fits nice 
playing an FPS shooter 
use the lowest dpi setting 
playing other games 
use the second lowest dpi 
surfing the 
mouse and if your like me and too lazy to get a mousepad you should be fine , it works great 
get a mousepad 
what it 's made 
it even has a DPI setting 
This does 
then I can edit the sensitivity 
Now just buy the mouse

Perfect sized

found this review helpful 
change my mouse pads since I work 
purchasing more because the quality is great 
found this review helpful 
it has the most amazing shade 
one has a different and smoother surface 
prevent a war 
sets it 
This drives another co-worker in the next cube over BAT-SH # T crazy 
keep the peace 
Yes please 
mouse likes it 
it was offered 
it gets the job done 
sometimes thats all 
It easily fits in my laptop case so it 's super portable 
it fits 
it all depends on what you use 
play sessions 
mostly use it to game with and I do tend 
say my mouse slides 
it adhere to my desk very tightly 
want a bigger one 
Product shipped on-time 
Product conforms to descriptions , as described 
Best mouse pad Ihave used 
It works great and I do not have to worry if kids destroy it , although it is quite durable 
works fine 
put your name on it as these tend 
Still using this mouse pad 
washed it 
It looks like new still 
buy these pads from now on 
bought a whole bunch 
it worked very well 
use a mouse 
mouse slips over it easier 
i own both 
so what can I say 
does its job 
It seems well made 
kind of mouse pad will make your mouse dirty 
that you need to plugin 
people like me get the fancy mousepads 
n't really do that 
provides laser mice a lot 
it 's there 
exactly what it 's meant to do 
n't ever notice this mousepad on your desk because it 's unobtrusive 
Enough said 
that does the job 
thin mouse pad , works very well 
things are better kept simple 
Works well with all ball and optical mice we use 
getting this 
what more can I say 
i read 
i 'd try it 
i slathered some 
set it 
it does have a rubber smell 
i did have an idea 
it dried very quickly 
i imagine 
this would work to swab 
that makes 
which it did 
alcohol would somehow contribute as well to sink 
why i thought of it , except i have hand sanitizer 
hands smell fresh 
Mine got a little bent 
hasnt affected 
use it 
That being said 
What 's to complain 
mouse works much better 
Exactly what I needed 
when ya need a mouse pad 
fancy , basic mouse pad , works well 
provide good sensitivity 
It works 
just what i wanted 
just add mouse 
It works as expected 
Cant beat the price 
had it 
edges have begun 
that 's expected 
mouse glides smoothly 
recommend this if you 're looking 
what I hoped 
exactly what I wanted 
wanted a mouse 
that had some button options 
that required 
rather wanted something 
batteries required 
sits the USB dongle 
It charges 
which quickly accepted the USB 
using the mouse 
click is very quiet 
hear pretty much nothing 
that gives a nice feel 
n't have a real mousepad 
instead use it 
it works perfectly 
dongle fits back 
impress your friends 
It changes colors 
who loves colorful things 
having problems 
n't all accept the same things 
accepts things quickly , my other computer refuses a lot 
find the dongle 
son loves this mouse to play 
It works perfectly 
connects very fast and battery runs 
just received it 
just got my package 
takes care 
tape really works for sewing 
make my own now 
Purchased this tape 
got another one 
what it does 
mouse glide smoothly 
Turned my cheapo plastic drawtube-type telescope focus mechanism 
Just applied this tape 
have a Imac 
hated the sound 
product works 
It slides 
made this product 
tape provides a nearly frictionless contact 
caveat is attaching the tape 
spooled onto the cardboard roll , the center section must have pulled tighter than the edges , leaving 
had 2 ` mouses ' to cover , I tried different techniques 
aligning its center 
Next , I used my thumbnail to tuck 
trimmed away the excess 
mouse surely glides nicely now 
section does n't drag 
it last 
Have a mouse 
it was dragging 
feet were getting worn 
it 's gliding all over the place now 
last a good long while on the roll should it wear 
mice squeak 
mouse was not only squeaking 
it was screaming , when moved 
make things even worse , it did n't do it 
saying ` EEEK 
it made 
it would catch 
say ` GRRRR 
So I bought this tape 
n't pull it too much 
eventually a piece tore 
Breathed some life back 
mouse is doing skiing 
only used it 
wanted it to be 
put strips 
friction disappeared 
It now slides easily 
move my cursor around 
keep a roll of this tape in my desk forever 
how such a small product such as this has completely changed my MacBook Pro experience 
read a number 
this solved the noisy and motion drag problems 
cut some lengths 
So I ordered this 
tape has made 
now the Apple mouse nicely glides across the wooden surface just as it should 
It 's taken 85 % of the noise away 
made a mouse 
that had such problems 
pointer initially flew 
recalled a time 
when it would glide 
read the reviews 
bought this to go 
it is not made 
use it anyway 
really enjoy the feel 
that is designed to be a slick surface 
also have a gaming mouse pad 
it works wonderfully 
It has lasted 
Tape expires 
use this 
Slides easily and gunk does n't stick to it as easily 
Had a mouse with some pretty bad pads so I bought 
it slides better 
Put it 
long the tape lasts 
Easy to use does what 
HATE mousepads so I use 
It used 
now it glides 
even want a second layer depending 
It does n't take much tape to fix up your mouse , either , so this should be all you ever need 
has a `` shelf life '' then it will probably `` go bad '' before you use 
that has too much drag 
using this 
it allows the door to slide 
used this 
It seems to be working 
this installed 
mouse glides across the desk now 
this works great 
one set 
this made 
last a long time 
FANTASTIC !!!! It is like putting spinners 
IT IS 
it makes 
it slide really smoothly 
which has a very large surface area 
use an Apple ` Magic Mouse 
has plastic 
need less friction on , cut 
old mice feel like new 
Value , makes 
whole family is amazed 
purchased this tape to bring 
put some 
mouse slid 
Yep , so works great 
made a world 
use a large unfinished butcher block countertop 
adding this tape 
old mice feel new again 
new mice feel newer 
also prefer a cloth mousepad 
have the best 
almost returned it 
make beautiful hardware 
that made the mouse mainstream 
hated it so much 
why the company that made the mouse mainstream ca n't seem to make 
surface I used it on 
it would scratch 
always carried a piece of blank paper to use 
stuck it 
loved the gesture support 
That said 
saw the fliders strips 
then I saw this tape 
bought the tape earlier 
reviews looked promising 
mouse just flies across most surfaces now 
it keeps going 
make a large difference 
Putting this tape 
using my mouse 
purchased an aluminium mouse pad because I thought 
it looks really cool 
cut two short strips 
it made a huge , positive difference 
purchased this tape 
just cut two short pieces 
n't ever see it 
get so much 
use so little 
mouse glide smooth 
what I expected 
several-year-old wireless mouse feels like a puck on an airhockey table after applying 
used it to replace 
have an Apple Magic mouse 
skids '' are not made 
Magic mouse cure!If you have an Apple Magic mouse , you know 
cut it 
It took about 5 min to apply 
Get this tape 
mouse was not sliding well any longer 
pads on the bottom of my Logitec mouse had worn 
That 's when I found 
sided tape coated 
it slides better 
put small pieces 
tape works great 
Now my mouse glides as if it was on a sheet 
tape is still working , so I may have 
applied the tape about 1 month ago 
replacing OEM skates 
sometimes a couple layers must be used in order to keep 
which fortunately can be done very quickly 
Recently applied this 
replacing it 
feet on my mouse came off so I bought 
it works great 
mouse now slides 
saved me some coin 
exactly what you want 
minimizes the sliding noise 
It makes your mouse slide easier 
replacing old mouse feet 
glide is exellent 
Sure , it wears 
have a lot of extra tape to replace 
that felt 
Had a previous mouse 
supply of mouse feet!As the other reviewers said 
so do n't stretch it out too long 
covering the adhesive back 
got a defect 
recently got the new Logitech MX Master to use 
add this to my Amazon shopping cart to try 
tape revived my Apple Magic Mouse so that it was QUIETER 
sure this roll of tape will last me a long time 
even after re-applying it to my mice whenever my old applications wear 
Used it 
where I needed a slick spot 
Worked as intended , clock is running great 
cut pieces 
stuff makes your mouse move 
i have ever used 
Works well for my gaming mouse , just replace the strips every few weeks to keep 
cutting board mouse pad 
buy the wider one if you have 
getting the right width 
seen a lot 
tape makes 
it feel almost like new 
only used about eight inches of tape to completely cover my old worn-out feet , leaving 
tape will last you forever 
's a better product out there since you can use 
already repaired 3 gaming mice 
use it for the bottom of my mouse to make 
it glide better 
use a metal mousepad these will make you literally slap yourself for not trying them sooner , changed my life 
these will make you literally slap 
that only lasts 
feeling of a brand new mouse/mousefeet that only lasts a day or two now lasts forever 
long you will be using it 
used Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical -LRB- great mouse btw -RRB- but the mouse feet were a little scratched 
bought this mouse tape 
Now my mouse feels brand new 
overlapping the tape to compensate 
aware that this tape might not be the best solution for mice with larger feet/pads since the tape is only .5 '' wide and overlapping the tape to compensate may not work so well 
exactly what you want it to do 
worn out teflon pads 
not count the number 
Renew the slide!However 
not expect the tape 
It 's not 
It wears out pretty quickly 
it starts dragging 
simply apply new tape 
yards will last 
run out of this tape I 'll surely order another 
perform perfectly , this one does perform perfectly 
It works well so far 
glide action is not whisper quiet 
Makes your mouse slide better 
need three x 3 '' strips to do 
Used this stuff to shim 
It now moves 
It also made a cheap mouse move much smoother 
only used it 
always wearing the bottoms 
Took a minute 
it glides better 
when I wear this out I have 
tried everything on my desk to get 
actually took the feet 
that worked better 
currently using a Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX 
saw this and well for whatever I paid , it seemed 
So , I made my own feet 
little board paper cut small pieces 
tape just pealed right off 
yet , it stays 
it takes so little 
's so much 
occasionally replace it , but there 's so much of it and it takes so little ... I replace the tape like every two or three months ... A guess 
replace the tape 
it gets dirty easily 
using it 
clean it 
have a microfiber cloth 
that was worked really well 
cleaned it 
get a new desk so 
again , I just wipe it 
needs cleaning 
n't have a problem 
that attaches 
instead it should go 
it would work to replace 
what I did 
That 's 
seemed to be dragging a bit , I put a small strip 
so my mouse gets tons 
issues of it peeling off .5 yards might not sound 
have less resistance 
It is meant to go 
com/us/products / mice/steelseries-sensei-mlg - editionIt makes your mouse move smoother 
It does not add significant height 
require somewhat frequent replacement 
It will last you a long time 
not use it 
so taped up a large amount 
it clings to glossy plastic very well 
It did not want to stick 
mice use that 
used an x-acto knife 
tools will make sure 
it adheres solidly as 
ordered a wider tape 
be that I should have ordered a wider tape , it would have taken half as long 
carefully cut off small pieces 
placed it 
then used an Exacto knife to cut 
it would slide out 
wanted it 
smoothly it hardly takes any effort 
Now , my mouse now moves 
this took less then 1 inch 
take some 
much recommended 
have a antifriction mouse mat 
Put it 
it glides beautifully 
it works 
need it to apply 
it did cover my existing ones well 
suggested , it will NOT work 
now found other surfaces that need extra slip and used it there , too 
that need extra slip 
used it there 
Color did not matter 
Ex : we slide our keurig machine 
now it glides 
feet left 
used it on 5 mice so far 
adhesive holds tightly , as long 
long the tape will last 
n't have a rough mouse pad 
it will definitely last a long time 
other reviews have stated this stuff 
's enough material 
glue on the feet of my mouse had let 
fought it for a long time by gluing 
bought PTFE feet 
tape works great 
that has held up much better 
Finally , I applied one more over-sized layer 
prevent an edge 
it seems like it floats 
used this with a Logitech G500 and a Func pad , the improvement is very noticeable , my mouse is so smooth 
i will reorder it 
product arrived 
use this on my Logitech G700 gaming mouse after the feet began 
small amount applied to each mouse foot will bring back the gliding feel and responsiveness as when you first used 
tape on the feet does need replaced 
others may have read elsewhere 
product is definitely cost effective 
mouse and home mouse were sticking on the mouse pads because the feet were worn 
Simply put a piece 
problem is solved 
mice now glide smoothly 
get a lot of tape for the money so it 's very cost-effective 
Tape make 
mouse glide 
old mouse now works as good 
which the pros use 
missing glide from when it was brand new 
little bit of this goes a long way 
Used this to refresh 
mice in the household and all people say 
roll will probably last for years unless I find 
definitely be picking up more rolls 
threw this tape on my magic mouse because it was not gliding 
using it 
Others have said 
Thank you CS Hyde 
used this tape 
It adhered well 
put it 
mouse feels much smoother 
gf also noticed 
This will also get rid 
mouse might make when in use 
poor mouse was dragging 
feet needed teflon 
It took about 5 minutes to tape 
OK ... did n't have a lot of hope here 
have a RAT 7 mouse 
which was worn 
tape saves 
Covers my worn ` feet 
hope not ... I WILL buy more 
tape may roll 
Trim it 
Tape may wear out if there is 
Guess what 
peel it 
What else do you want 
it makes sense 
beat this , it looks 
use it 
Refreshes your mouse 
feet started dragging 
not sell replacement feet 
feet start dragging 
waiting God only how long 
that makes it easier for the tape to conform 
inside edge hang 
who are going to see 
just approximated the outside curve 
mentioned , the thin tape conformed very well 
smoothly the mouse moved 
long the tape will last since it is so thin 
cost less than shipping the mouse back to Logitech would have cost 
put this tape 
put the tape 
results look good 
used only a foot of tape to cover 
feet left 
Hyde makes a 1 '' wide PTFE tape 
It works every bit 
just cut some 
trim the tape 
that overhangs the side 
apply it 
applied it 
almost use this tape 
addressing mouse feet issues 
It also works 
So having bought 5 mouse 
which lead 
it seems 
bought the teflon dots 
received my tape today I decide time 
say something 
never not use teflon material again 
gliding across the pads and accuracy is not affected 
protecting my pads 
extra precision and invested in a great mouse and pad , why not protect that 
try the tape out next 
Currently using the dots 
price goes 
ordered 100 
friend asked 
that he wanted 
what I owned 
found the pad 
bought it 
Tells me its great 
friend likes the pad 
make recommendations 
who took my order 
what you need 
has a wonderful personality 
get a giant roll so that you can cover 
what else to tell you except it comes 
gone , you could just cover the bottom 
It repositions and trims well 
touches itself adhesive to adhesive , just cut it 
do 20-30 mice easily 
Purchased this tape to extend 
tape works great 
It allows the mouse to slide 
well I also use it 
easily like it did when new.-Tape is very adhesive 
it would pull 
prolong the life 
tape did n't cover my mouse feet exactly 
so you ca n't just cut another piece 
wider tape would work 
what to expect 
It does not add any thickness 
So you can not ` add ' other points 
raise your mouse feet if other parts of the mouse are dragging 
It is best used on top of the original mouse feet as on some mice if you remove 
it will allow other parts of the mouse to touch 
bought this to use 
it works great 
used this to cover 
mouse scraped very loudly 
it glides beautifully 
expecting some sound to remain 
thickness seems perfect 
it stays put 
bought this CS Hyde PTFE tape because I was concerned 
LOVE this mouse 
control '' side of my reversible Razer metal mouse pad was causing too much wear 
it no longer had 
side of my Razer pad had become so worn 
cut it a bit longer 
then smooth the ends 
cover the mouse feet 
it takes about 4 inches of tape to cover 
Then I cut the 16 '' x 16 '' CS Hyde PTFE mouse pad 
placed one 
reverse side of the CS Hyde pad has a tacky , sticky feel 
pad is made 
it is best used 
tape does 
It serves the same purpose 
which are very reasonably priced 
coating on the tape might wear out too fast otherwise 
buy both products because I think 
put pieces 
thickness of the tape made the mouse non-functional 
It works well too 
things like this tape wont adhere to them well 
It will stick better to the plastic near the mouse feet than to the feet themselves because the feet are meant 
so do n't overlap pieces 
tape really is n't going to stick to itself either because it 's super low-friction 
that need to be used 
These do an equally good job 
that works well 
why they thought the two minor lights 
Profiles make switching 
Grip feels really great 
move the lower index finger button 
this improved 
one has preformed 
that I have ever seen 
anyone could really benefit 
that have more buttons 
mouse has buttons 
has a mode button so you can define 
It comes 
tune the weight 
that you can insert underneath to help 
maybe I just ca n't feel it 
not feel a different 
offer some difference 
moved the weights around 
When I changes the FPS 
it can go 
n't use it 
using Windows I have the speed set a little slower , so I can accurate click 
speed it 
speed it 
It has a couple LEDs 
it match the color scheme 
that you can change 
computer looks 
assign so many options 
n't need the keyboard as much 
make unique modes 
mouse will automatically adopt these modes when the game starts 
do that 
game has different modes 
software lets 
Also , you can set a single mode 
when I release the button 
So , for example , I slow the mouse way down 
click this button to slow 
it goes back 
when I pull up the scope 
only scratching the surface 
n't have any complaints 
that it can support 
use it as a standard 3 button wheel mouse , ignoring 
it works fine 
It does n't require you to learn 
i 'll use olny 
Prefer this over Deathadder , although both are great FPS mice 
ive waited 5 months before making 
highly recomend this mouse 
who is thinking 
it still feels 
get a lot more headshots 
that I have ever used 
had mice with macro buttons on them before 
buttons right next to the left mouse click 
Easy to use 
this is completely fit my hand 
It have many useful button 
that can config some mecro 
paling a game 
also i can control the dpi and wheel when 
Mouse , FPS MouseFirst used Razer Naga Hex 
which i really hated 
that makes 
cursor move around on screen when you play 
it will just break 
also the scroll wheel feel low quality 
it feels 
then i got Razer Deathadder Chroma 
i will click it 
i did buy it 
Now with the G502 Proteus Spectrum , i thought to get 
when i tried to use 
i thought okay 
i will try to put 
have that 
what i thought 
try it 
used my DA Chroma 
it seems tiny 
usually when i used a heavy mouse 
when i got 
good and i loved how accurate the aiming is with this mouse while playing The Division - The weights 
i never used mouse 
it felt slower 
i left the DPI keys 
feel the pulling weight 
weight makes the left distance shorter 
heavy its , first it makes 
only select one profile since i am not really a fan 
it seems about right 
so when i left it up to move 
it just doesnt move at all after i stop 
playing with it for couple hours actually i 
sometimes increase it 
keys feel really good 
i hate the idea 
wheel is a freaking bless 
wheel feels nice also 
just press it 
thing just keep on scrolling 
easy , the only thing here free scrolling up seems a lot slower 
turn the wheel 
i will still give the mouse 5 stars 
cant stop it mid way 
scroll normally whith the scroll wheel , talking about very short scrolls like one tick , it feels to move 
normally whith the scroll wheel 
when you download the program 
wheel makes noise when you move 
mouse left 
It functions perfectly fine , however 
software makes it 
give your extra mouse buttons different functions 
change which settings 
which means 
also assign a `` g-shift '' button 
which will give all the other buttons alternate functions 
assigned `` windows 
desktop and the right scroll wheel opens the next right tab 
middle button shows 
opened a new display 
Pressing both 
have one screen 
somehow it tricked the system into shifting 
reverse the process 
it failed 
that brought me back 
which sucks 
got big hands 
it still feels perfect 
THIS IS TOO FAST !! 
that 's 
when you unlock the scroll wheel 
have the Sniper button 
need another 
had several gaming mice 
add more wts 
buttons are very well laid 
buttons respond really well 
recommend this mouse 
absolutely loves it 
have the Corsair equivalent 
construction does n't feel quit 
feels like a perfect replacement except the sensitivity of the buttons felt weird at first 
Got it to replace 
have the interchangeable grips of the G9 , it fits my hand quite well 
heal ti tip 
software could use some work 
Sometimes it does n't detect the game process if it launches 
purchased this mouse 
mouse works great with the Logitech gaming software as 
n't have the extra grip 
lights , all i need to say 
that you can do 
which took me about a week to get used 
did the exact same thing 
only negative -LRB- and I say this loosely -RRB- is the braiding 
that encases the cord 
it easily starts bunching 
previously owned the predecessor to this mouse , the Proteus Core 
play Overwatch 
had most 
map the buttons to Resolve 
play CS 
never missclick any 
it is working just fine 
it is not recommended 
recommend it 
Logitech is really making 
better gear compare 
used razer 
mouse absolutely owns the other brands 
who has this complaint -RRB- Durable buttons 
Cord is made 
shorten or shorten it if desiredThe optional metal weights are no gimmick 
went a very long way 
improving my experience 
it works perfectly 
Does everything 
it claims 
pink lightingScroll wheel may seem rather heavy 
light settings give you red light 
n't imagine getting 
Left handed people 
have a great deal 
Loving it so far 
purchased this mouse 
upgraded his pc a few months ago 
performance of this mouse is matching the high end specs 
used this mouse 
i also read 
mouse is highly rated 
Had a programmable Corsair Mouse 
size of the mouse and the location of the bottons make it easy to game 
does everything 
it says 
always accidentally click the dpi up button 
Fantastic mouse , love every thing about it except for one thing , the dpi up and down buttons are inconveniently placed for me , when I play 
mouse works 
bought this to use 
slaughtering fools 
still use my MX518 
G502 will last as long 
son loves this 
n't adjust the height 
mouse detects a surface 
use all weight except for the second 
download logitchs software so you can fully customize 
Logitech thought this one though 
buttons have a clean , audible tactile response 
some do 
activate the infinity scroll 
customize your DPI presets 
it only has 2 styles 
recommend this mouse 
who uses a desktop 
that will replace my G9X 
G9X started dying after 6 years of use I was afraid 
still I want the same feel 
bought this Logitech G502 
had a courage 
searching and watching youtube 
guess what 
get your webcam and headsets too so I can review 
what else to say 
it fits well 
purchased this mouse 
use it 
also has a cool designGet 
if-u play fps games 
on-u want mouse fast reaction time 
use the buttons 
who says 
mouse does n't make a difference 
using this 
Have had this mouse for 6 months now 
had no problems 
Fast shipped 
mouse will stay with me forever 
mouse has satisfied all 
recommend this to any gamer or anyone using 
wanted a lot more buttons 
mouse seemed to fit 
It has 4 buttons 
left buttons 
It has a scrollwheel 
that can also tilt 
kinda `` unlock '' it 
it can scroll up/down 
it locked so it behaves 
never use this 
's also a DPI button 
It also has a modifying button thing that can be thought of as an fn button for the mouse buttons , so this effectively doubles 
that can be thought 
much play MMOs without relying 
this has made my life so much more comfortable 
that you attach 
mouse , you can have a heavier mouse 
switch the LED 
turn it off if you want 
profile you 're on -LRB- which you can also change 
that tell 
Aesthetically , it looks 
mouse do n't know 
what else to say 
purchased the G502 
that wore 
It does look a bit 
that may appeal 
It does n't bother me either 
best feature is mapping the mouse buttons 
have one configuration 
have another 
tweak all the colors 
that lets 
even have a button 
using Logitech 's ' 5-series ' gaming mice 
one continues the tradition 
colors could be set to exactly match 
it works perfectly fine 
mainly use it 
product seems pretty durable 
wheel is extremely satisfying to use 
clicks feel 
1st bought the MMO Red Dragon mouse 
Returned it 
keeping this mouse for sure 
VERY WELL the mouse clicks and wheel work perfectly 
It works GREAT the buttons 
play WoW 
wheel lite up too 
n't use any of the weighs though 
i can reach every button just fine 
weights make it nice 
RGB looks awesome 
using it my wrist 
longer has pain 
one turned out to be best 
several mice fit 
have reports 
unlock the scroll wheel 
use the `` sniper '' button for finer movement when formatting 
this has it 
Adjusting the DPI 
have three monitors 
extra weights allows you to get 
Solid build quality 
that i used to have 
i bought this one 
Loved the proteus core 
that is waiting for you to come 
when you do its just a pleasure 
that 's never failed me yet 
give the mouse the perfect heft 
coordinate it 
LOVE the LED lighting so I can color 
gave this 
it does everything 
left his weight alone 
love Razer products , I wo n't be giving up these logitech mice anytime soon 
personally use a G602 wireless , giving 
kiddo loves this so much 
buying one for those times I am feeling 
far this has proved to be a very responsive mouse 
that require different levels 
who occasionally plays a few RTS 
have very large hands 
it fits nicely 
that broke 
mouse was purchased to replace 
mouse-wheel started to become 
most mouses have 
it has a feel 
upgrade from the previous G502 looks much more sleek 
n't get the deathadder 
customizable profiles and the scroll wheel take the cake 
wheel spins for a very long time if you give 
removable weights feature because it not only allows 
it stores the settings inside the mouse if you select 
it to do so 
run in Linux , my preferred OS , it does run 
profiles and settings are stored 
Recommend it 
what to do 
It has a lower dpi 
it served me well 
this is a must have 
get great feedback 
middle wheel is actually made out of metal so when scrolling you get great feedback , this mice comes 
sure it will last 
nothing else competes 
Got it 
it does the job 
who regularly plays games 
tried razer mouses 
it does n't feel too overwhelming 
has just enough buttons 
sometimes adding a weight 
taking one away 
software took 
little getting used to but its fairly easy to use 
Has matte grip so my skin does n't melt 
how you can change the sensitivity 
it 's got a good feeling 
tune it because it comes 
It has several little buttons 
where the wheel spins indefinitely 
It also has adjustable DPI up to 12,000 so you can get 
plastic , it does n't have a cheap or flimsy feel 
It 's got a nice feel 
It also has lighting 
that can be changed 
had a 
options were limited 
Razers were pretty but the finishing wore 
customizing DPI 
G500 had great customization but , whether due to logitech or not , the software for customizing DPI stopped 
mouse has the quick DPI switching 
which works 
set 5 points 
button can be individually programmed however you like 
's also an additional ` AIM ' button 
button can toggle 
which I find useful 
which tends to break 
lights ... it 's got those too!Overall a great purchase 
who is trying to find 
give G502 a try 
shapes look very different 
which just came 
take out some potential confusion 
say closest , I meant the micro-gear 
using a Razer Vaspula pad 
none of them worked 
tested G500s 
smash my G500s 
Literally I felt a strong impulse 
laid my hand 
It required tons 
give G502 a try 
Still , such a pity Logitech gave 
It used to be the personal brand mouse 
Buttons feel solid , grips well - super ergonomic 
what I was waiting for 
used the razer deathadder for a year before buying 
that come with it make 
weights make a real difference 
prefer Logitech 
own a bunch 
mouse has a button 
that releases the mouse wheel so you can scroll 
what made 
It works very well , better 
additional buttons make playing 
monster just got me a 21/6 frag 
it 's 
what differs 
that produces gaming mice 
i mean seriously 
efficient gaming mice , i mean seriously , would you expect any traces 
best gaming mouse I 've ever had , I use a fingertip grip 
it feels awesome 
many buttons do n't disturb my grip , as some mentioned me earlier 
buy a thousand times 
never had anything other 
wanted something 
exactly what I wanted 
has a nice heft 
adds a nice affect 
overall it feels well crafted 
have no difficulty 
reaching any 
pick i 
wheel seems a little looser 
using this mouse 
absolutely LOVE this mouse 
use it 
prefer the placement similar 
Fits great/feels amazing-click scroll wheel 
button -LRB- quick DPI change -RRB- depresses really easily 
use it a lot 
what I 'm doing 
gun I 'm using 
normally use 3700 DPI 
use it 
it fits my hand comfortable 
used it 
mouse just looks great the way 
It gives excellent grip where it 's needed 
It took a long time 
Product came perfectly 
it comes 
have an infinite scroll wheel 
it 's really limited if you use 
find a good feeling mouse 
It fits my hand 
It works exactly as you would expect 
It 's 
what the Cue software with Corsair should have been 
it is easily changed 
even add macros to each button as well!The DPI sensitivity is insane 
set 5 individual levels 
where your thumb rests 
also include a DPI shift 
which is accessed by holding 
It can be used 
some use it to heighten 
It makes scrolling 
allow it to spin 
it `` click '' every so often 
restricting the mouse by making it `` click '' every so often , you can release the mouse wheel 
also use it normally , if you wish 
All in all , if you have the money , buy this mouse 
Exactly what my son expected ... great price 
boyfriend absolutely loves this 
Son loves it 
got it 
best mouse I 've had love the extra weights have all but one in so it 's heavier on the right buttons are comfortably placed 
extra weights have all but one in so it 's heavier 
had love 
wife uses it 
This works and looks the part 
Great mouse , came 
exactly what he wanted 
mouse feels great 
G502 can be customized every which way 
only having 1 G symbol 
system works flawlessly 
added more light sources 
click it again 
what so ever making it awkward feeling 
has no rubber 
have a love/hate relationship with is the darn mouse wheel 
mouse also goes up to 12,000 DPI 
have no clue 
which can be remapped anyways 
thing has buttons 
there hitting the dpi 
button is also very well placed 
also be remapped but works great for FPS when you need 
still adding more weights 
which G502 comes with 5 weights to tailor 
people already claim 
Final thoughts on this mouse , give me more RGB lighting 
use a mouse 
have a LOT of hours using 
What I 'm trying to get at 
everyone has their own preferences 
bought this mouse 
It finally gave up the ghost 
wheel is made 
It feels really nice 
underneath is attached via a magnet so it stays 
open it - reasonably easy 
placement all seems very well 
how they moved one of the buttons to be a `` trigger '' button 
It does n't bother 
it might bother others 
have an above averaged size hand 
wear L gloves 
This does n't really bother 
awesome looking 
wish the texture 
wheel clicks 
require a substantial more amount 
which can move 
one requires more effort 
applied it will start to move 
that runs 
prefer it to just be one piece 
It does n't serve a purpose other 
which will just collect sweat 
OverallI still give it a 5 despite the cons , because it really is by far , the best mouse 
have two problems 
None of the other colour transitions have this problem , just this one 
wheel has two modes 
this click 
it click 
it not click 
Even bumping the mouse too hard without touching 
when I use it 
designating certain functions 
programmable keys can do many things 
build quality 
it feel heavier if you like 
Setting up the Logitech software 
Have the G502 non-RGB 
get the RGB one as 
Use it 
exactly what I expected 
absolutely loves it 
Logitech never lets 
everything worked as expected 
Has a great feel 
i can adjust speed 
having a mouse 
desire the reliability 
use the `` Custom surface detector '' via the Logitech software if you experience 
Smooth , accurate , lots of functions , comfortable - could n't ask 
who is doing LOLgame everyday 
originally my husband suggested me to buy 
buy it 
Additionally , the weights that can be added or removed make it fairly customizable 
that can be added 
Personally , I dig the weights 
recommend this mouse 
loved my original G502 so when they came 
high end gaming mice had just as many button options 
Best fitting mouse i ever had 
playing game 
overall build is good 
Replaced my razer deathadder 
teenage son feels 
it 's sized well 
liked the mods 
Really loved it 
so there 's no way 
fits fine 
bought it 
Going fine 
update this review 
crisp clean click on 1 and 2 buttons and weight adjustment very nice 
has two settings , though I use 
Spin wheel 
using it 
especially while playing PC games 
when it comes 
RGB lighting to go 
mouse do endless things 
using the Logitech software 
it will become comfortable 
texture feels nice 
had a silent 
click mouse before 
spent HOURS 
it feels 
how it reads your mouse pad 
using this mouse for about 4 months now 
spend a lot 
that are lying around 
used the Logitech G5 a long time ago 
much I liked that 
doing some comparison work 
this may appeal 
mouses seem simpler 
that layed nicely 
wanted a mouse 
just felt right 
that the G502 has to offer 
customize dpi speedCons 
Took me some getting use 
Mouse will not `` feel '' right 
it would suit most teens/adults 
using wireless mice 
used it 
ordered the wireless counterpart 
enjoyed the mouse so much 
Price is a steal 
have 3 or 4 others 
using the G502 
it completely destroys any other mouse 
highly recommend this mouse to you if you 're looking 
have the same comfortable experience 
Programmable buttons - That allow you to Easily Tailor 
browsing - Easy on the fly DPI switcher - Flawlessly switch 
Have the most accurate FPS experience 
slow down your DPI 
colors - Built in game button recognition programmable macros - Save five different DPI levels 
Loving it 
Use it more 
added the weights 
Non-gamers do n't really need this wired mouse 
Just get a wireless mouse instead 
n't notice a different 
mouse feels absolutely fantastic 
it fit in my small lady hands comfortably 
it also fits in my husbands big man hands comfortably 
configure the buttons 
it figured out it 's pretty easy 
that comes in handy when you need 
mouse itself has a very sturdy feel 
where your palm rests 
n't let that make-or-break your purchase decision 
braided cable is also very well made 
use this 
program the buttons 
it sometimes takes a few seconds 
starting up the computer it sometimes takes a few seconds for the Logitech software to load , and until then , the mouse behaves like it 's on its default settings 
definitely purchase it again 
got it when I saw 
using the non-rgb model before 
other mouse key is not missing 
using google translation 
enthusiast do not get 
what to do 
Set the leds to red 
it looks great 
far , the best mouse i 've ever owned 
Put the full weights 
have all the extra buttons 
click a button 
Has a nice long braided cable 
not had any issues with it so far 
find the right 
left click to have 
n't had nearly as many accidental clicks 
Had a previous Logitech mouse 
replace it 
thumb is constantly bumping them while playing 
it will work 
thumb rested lower 
etc. does n't seem to be loaded 
that you may not think 
Have a great feel 
It is definitely made 
Claw grip 
easily place the base 
still hit almost all the buttons extremely easily 
well-designed game is going to automatically lower 
That being said 
easily reassign it 
it has some things 
used it 
hit the toggle in-game 
software is fairly well designed 
which can cause you to switch 
Adjusting the Dpi 
options are fairly limited 
darker colors are not going to be very bright 
That sounds dumb 
have pretty much any in-game function 
change controls in-game 
this means 
switch to the onboard profiles and forget , the buttons you are used to pressing are not what you expect them to be , so just make sure 
highly recommend this mouse 
software , although not perfect , has no glaring issues 
All in all , you should definitely buy this mouse if you are in the market 
bought this to replace 
which still works 
just wanted a new one 
it looks cooler 
G is lit 
change the dpi buttons 
software lets 
surprised competitors have n't replicated this 
highly recommend this mouse 
buttons are put 
One allows the wheel to rotate 
spinning a coin 
second mode enables a `` stopper 
much since the standard blue already fits my build 
n't really use it 
Build quality as reliable 
not need a new one 
bought this 
G900 started to randomly disconnect 
it just completely would n't connect 
Even when the cable was directly connected 
G502 works great , no issues 
what I expect 
girlfriend and I passed up on this mouse originally , thinking 
hit all 5 buttons 
never had one 
where I can reach all 
used a lot 
allows the changes to be saved 
software provides a lot 
not get the same lighting pattern 
that bothers 
FPS play games 
store the profiles 
how you can program buttons to perform 
buttons will do 
what you want them to even when connected 
macros and all the settings are stored 
it replaced 
Had the G402 mouse 
enjoy the G502 
This has helped quite a bit 
that I have ever had 
It fits very well 
tune it 
mouse would not fit well if someone had 
anyone could use it 
just plugging it 
software that you download from Logitechs website allows you to alter 
that you download 
mouse also has a physical button 
that acts 
turn it 
wheel will glide easily 
turn this break on 
who wants a mouse 
Cons * Wired mouses 
Pros * High customizability with sensitivity and features including weightFits in your hand extremely wellSoftware from Logitech allows you to alter 
highly recommend this mouse 
that fits comfortably 
g502 makes 
Legends and I 've noticed that my clicks are more tactile and responses are faster but take this witha grain of salt since I 'm coming 
take this witha grain 
use it 
purchased this mouse after using 
Prior to that mouse I had a Logitech G5 
wheel stopped working less than a year into ownership so I decided 
had great experience 
shape of the mouse looks strange when looking 
mouse fits my hand very well 
using the logitech software 
adjust the weight of it to how I like 
using a Razer deathadder for the last two years , the first 
used a non-Logitech mouse 
how the mouse handles 
that form a ring 
felt good moving side 
weights gave the mouse a nice heft 
turns out that being able to drop my DPI on the fly greater improved my accuracy 
some getting used to as there were 
placement takes 
what to do 
that let 
n't miss the Deathadder 
bought this mouse 
THIS IS A STEAL 
who play 
had high expectations 
mouse exceeded all 
weights adds a great tactile feel 
This works great when you are playing 
this would be better more rounded 
Product arrived quickly 
It works great 
mouse looks great 
M705 which is for business use , this mouse has a more accurate positioning 
which allows to move 
mouse can not be detected 
that helps 
keep track 
also really enjoy the high DPI 
have 4 speed settings 
considering my hands 
model came with the wings on both sides to prevent 
software has a very user friendly UI and is easy to use , though I had 
getting it to recognize 
run it 
have this problem 
recommend this , especially on sale like it is at the time 
paid full price 
needed a new mouse desperately 
This replaced my old Microsoft Intelli-mouse 
how they added RGB lighting 
say enough good things 
some of the best accuracy ive ever seen 
took a long time 
used a microsoft mouse for literally 18 years and took a long time to get used to this mouse being different but im glad i got this one since the old one was getting 
now i find 
which makes 
accidently changing the dpi 
owned Logitech as long 
n't use all the weights 
have the logitech orion spectrum keyboard 
which I thought 
has a thumb rest 
that has DPI changes 
that drastically reduces the DPI 
experiencing double clicking issues 
It took me a few days 
it look better 
it feels so much more premium 
really liking it 
replaced my old Logitech 
Setting the light 
still produces a blue tint 
mouse feels great 
Overall , mouse movements and button clicks 
it feels 
It looks weird 
this feels better 
Although , I still prefer the G602 
son likes this one better 
G602 take 1 or 2 AA batteries 
lasts a while 
again Logitech has surpassed expectations , Supplying 
noticed a huge performance increase 
installing the software 
Tuning a custom Mouse pad 
have 3 default presets 
which would technically turn off the setting 
Which I highly recommend 
only takes 1 minute 
This reads your mousepad 
draws a map of sorts to tell 
select Lighting Zones 
Choose a lighting effect 
Choose a color 
it will fade in 
choose practically any color 
have 16.8 Million Colors to choose 
matching your build 
Check mark 
never pay more than $ 
What you should look 
what a mouse should have .1 
So lets break 
check every one 
Laser increased movement tracking greatly resulting 
kept the same mouse 
that requires a very accurate mouse reading 
suggest it 
never purchased a gaming mouse before but I can tell 
's enough buttons 
using it 
just set a button to swap 
colors can be changed on the mouse once you program 
DPI led lights to show 
profile you got selected 
adjust the speed 
it comes with I really like the ease 
not used the weights 
currently using a Reflex lab heavy extended mouse pad 
wanted the best out there 
it and the variable weights give it a nice heft 
not used a macros mouse 
It feels weird 
People have different sized hands , use different grips 
have different sized hands 
have very small hands 
use a palm grip 
most because it feel reminds 
that I had forever 
looking , I was seriously considering the deathadder chroma 
liked the way 
it fit into my hand a lot 
n't pull the trigger on it because of how freakishly light it seemed 
G502 has some heft 
who likes a light feel 
n't suggest it 
A must have 
Top notch feel 
Mine get 's plenty of use and is still going strong 
Excellent mouse , provides 
adjustability one could ever hope 
that I had so far 
which you can switch 
best game controller yet ... -LRB- this is model # 4 -RRB- and the most pricey ... everything seems programmable 
this before -RRB- so when I moved the mouse 
wheel would move - big prob 
this adds the clickable tension to hold 
use 4 
buy another 
owned the razer death adder 
mouse knocks those 
what they 're doing 
Logitech knows 
got this to replace 
customizable has tons 
friend loves his new mouse 
!!!!! just the right amount 
use it 
i chose the Proteus 
Enjoying it 
i ever had 
Most accurate mouse I ever owned 
frictionless scrolling comes 
Has a cool design - very stealthy 
have small hands 
claw grip 
damage the buttons when pressing 
not forget the infinite scroll too 
that goes 
used macro keys and it still has 
It works as expected 
additions of weights really allows for the user to tailor 
highly recommend it 
it make take 
Great mouse looks great feels 
Good mouse , I 've been using it 
it fits them well 
have big hands 
grandson says 
always used Logitech mice 
using it 
using it 
it would just feel weird 
It contours well 
mechanical THUNK on the middle mouse click 
Left and right click are responsive 
just been randomly clicking it 
adore this mouse.-I 
Overall I 'd hugely recommend this mouse 
it feel your own because it can be however light 
having interchangeable weights 
scrolling and fast you can unlock the wheel 
keep it 
addition of having the scroll wheel have two modes 
having the scroll wheel 
which feels nice 
it will just keep scrolling 
where you can unlock the stopper so if you like 
customize this mouse to whatever you can think 
which lets 
Then you have the Logitech Gaming Software 
setting up the mouse to be gaming shortcuts on the sides , having macros with the buttons , hot changing the DPI on the side can all be done 
changing the DPI 
want it to be which is great 
Rubber gripping 
prevents gross slippery feeling 
Most comfortable mouse I 've ever used - Rubber gripping on the side adds more comfort and prevents gross slippery feeling if palm gets 
customize the colors 
it still works 
friends use this same mouse 
unlock the scroll wheel 
care that much 
had it 
customize button functions 
scroooolllllllll -LRB- not that I care that much , but it 's a lot of fun -RRB- - 6 extra buttons -LRB- aside from clicks and wheel -RRB- - Can download Logitech software 
lights `` breathe '' , fade 
adjust brightness - Kinda wish 
bought one of the cheap similar mouses on Amazon before 
it lasted for 3 months before the middle click stopped 
So for $ 70 this one is supposed to last 
Avid PC gamers might care more 
bought a few cheap mice to replace 
that I had 
Logitech has always been satisfying 
Here 's some pros 
Quality feel 
Ca n't go wrong 
keep all the lights 
son loves it 
plays his games everyday 
customize it 
what is is supposed to do 
back button started to stick 
had no issues 
expect similar performance form 
had Logitech mice 
that has lasted 6 years + 
use this mouse 
not having responsive touchThis mouse 
use it 
Well , I do n't usually write reviews 
thing deserved it 
It 's shaped 
has a very premium feeling 
just got another mouse 
Getting more `` kills '' now 
Works very well ssys 
using Steelseries Kinzu V3 
customize all buttons 
create 3 profiles 
what you want 
n't install extra weight to mouse because I think 
just buy it 
son loves this mouse 
Purchased a 2-year protection plan 
Get it 
Stop playing 
had the g500s model 
install software 
really like having the multiple dpi settings 
wont really make much use 
it contours to my hand personally 
precise mouse works great 
tried in my life , I had one 
What can I say 
G500 finally died 
playing COD 
that I found to be great 
buy this , you wo n't regret it 
recommending this to every one of my friends if they ask 
Uses the G series manager software so I have 
mouse replaced my aging Logitech MX510 
It checks all the boxes 
removeable/configurable weights , on-the-fly DPI adjustment , 3 thumb G-buttons , and 2 index finger G-buttons , and killer looks 
G502 has a `` G 
that can be tuned via Logitech 's software to match 
achieved a wicked black/orange color motif 
probably replace it 
G602 ever fails 
Thankfully the accompanying weights helped 
whenever i need to 
achieve that 
when playing games since it messes 
almost never used it 
It also did n't allow me to have a perfectly comfortable grip on the mouse since it is located 
where I normally put my thump 
which I also own 
Same thing goes 
However this can differ 
that the logitech gaming software have 
It come 
Just watch League 
what I mean 
that has been since resolved 
Originally , I received an open box product 
sold it 
n't buy one 
software leaves a lot 
highly highly recommend it 
built a PC 
not owned or used a gaming mouse 
need to train myself to use the ancillary buttons more in everyday computing , they work great when gaming 
already have a preference 
what might work 
guy just looking for a solid mouse in between gaming and everyday use , you absolutely can not go wrong 
it feels perfect 
It felt light 
adjusted the weight right away 
which this mouse does very well 
value most 
click feels substantial 
it works 
it has made a big difference 
it did n't install properly the first few times 
it worked 
accompanying overlay software it worked , not cool 
n't use it 
that I use very often 
commands that I use very often , The mouse can detect 
software you are using 
use the Logitech software to map 
it works 
use it together 
first one still works 
it has lost the some 
it has the heft 
really provide a mechanical connection 
that adjust sensitivity 
somehow the cord always manages to be out of the way 
hit one accidentally exactly once , while intensely drunk 
using it 
change the color 
paid full price 
some getting used 
It took 
when you can get this 
prefer the higher palm rest 
overall build quality 
back/forward side buttons took 
some getting used 
looking for a nice computer mouse , you should definitely give this one a shot 
job done 
It feels great 
it actually gets 
change the colors 
Worth every penny , stop reading 
use claw 
bought it 
it was before I purchased the mouse 
infinite scroll wheel may seem 
it comes in handy 
browsing the interwebs 
that feels very comfortable 
use a claw grip when gaming and a palm grip with regular use and it is very nice 
all feel awesome 
Tracking is great 
how it cleans 
using a G500 
it comes 
just what I expect 
bought this for my wife since she is the gamer 
worry , she tried it 
running the Logitech G5 
's a lot of reviews on this product already 
what feels 
pointer just goes where you want 
adjust all sorts 
enable extra features 
have other Logitech hardware on your machine , it will detect those too 
have a 1080P 
it let 
adjust new options on it as 
then I used it 
button seemed pointless 
accuracy in game increased dramatically 
it was n't going to be 
that 's why I kept 
Get the Logitech software 
It allows you to calibrate 
it DOES 
make a difference 
DPI setting to what feels 
take the 5 minutes to tune 
Go play some games 
feel the difference 
Buy it 
mouse is the smack 
Having fantastic balance 
it work well 
not find an acceptable option 
product met and exceeded the expectation 
play for every game ive played since receiving 
It has completely changed 
it felt a little light 
adding the customizable weight bricks 
it feels alot better 
customize the mouse 
downloading the software 
It took a few minutes 
recommend it 
that I 've gotten 
who has big hands 
when I first got it 
Threw all the weights 
understand the dilemma 
that could go wrong 
Which probably wo n't happen 
used Logitech mice for as long 
upgraded my dying G700s mouse 
one has worked 
well , I do n't mind the interference 
that the wire causes 
It does everything 
mouse does 
side mouse buttons look obtrusive 
hand wraps 
it probably makes it a lot more durable 
it constantly weighs the mouse down 
Just pull up a bit more wire 
Voila , you have a perfect amount 
what every button does 
playing an FPS 
have logitech mouse 
use its software 
find its software 
geek or want to modify some mouse features 
need software to do 
n't actually need software to use 
It 'd take some time before getting used 
it feels great 
adjust the mouse 
GO in my opinion , I 've used a basic office mouse 
how the RGB lights behaved 
only thing I wish you could do is really change 
that seem to only use 
dimple stops 
fact that you can move around the weights seems gimmicky 
adjust the mouse sensitivity 
Picked up this mouse after using 
mouse puts it 
has a plethora 
n't play many competitive shooters 
prefer gaming mice 
reprogram the extra buttons to do 
Bought the mouse 
LOVE the feel 
LED can configure 
DPI adjust 
well taken care 
Build quality 
reach all of the buttons very easly 
only downside i can think 
however for everyone else enjoy one 
programmable buttons come in handy too 
scroll works amazing 
It has a interchangeable weight system 
It defiantly has fast response speeds 
fits my play style very nicely 
it feels 
liked it so much 
Bought a second one 
ROCKS !! 
go hold 
It looks very cool 
buttons are surprisingly well placed 
store virtually unlimited profiles 
mouse has one 
highly reccomend it 
It arrived 
picked this up to replace 
juice spilled inside 
that got 
still open it 
do a review 
also customize the settings 
Hand gets a little sweaty 
sensor just makes the 
researched and chose this mouse because it has been very highly rated 
that varies 
It fits perfectly 
software will detect your installed games so you can create 
have various commands 
throw grenades 
removing my hands 
change DPI 
what really makes it useful 
It does n't come 
USB cord is also braided 
this works perfectly 
need a mouse 
using G700S wireless and i wont to try 
Good choice for this price , buy it 
Got it 
not use the adjustable weight since I am comfortable 
n't lost traction 
glitch for the G502s looking up/stuck/spinning was solved after a firmware update 
disable all 
also assign the two buttons 
working tuning mode allows equal performance 
Looks cool 
Smooth , weights make a big difference if you 're used 
came brand new and quick delivery 
Best mouse ive owned great extra buttons 
It 's exactly 
what I need when I old gaming mouse died 
put my hand 
that makes anything 
personally do n't play many games 
all of the latest and best tech equipment that comes out is marketed 
thus this mouse is marketed 
that comes out 
that I have 
customization that I have on the physical mouse as well as the software tweaks 
loved it 
weights in it 's noticeably lighter than the g500 and the sensor is placed closer to the center so it 's less twitchy 
i have n't had any trouble 
matching the colors 
hands smell bad 
that does n't seem to be the case 
older version of this mouse had rubber that would make your hands smell bad , so far 
that would make 
wanted it 
Does everything 
hardware rated this 10/10 best overall gaming mouse 
bought this 
had his Logitech G500 
colleague have the G502 Proteus core 
really liked it 
it was a toss up between this one and the proteus core because I really did 
keyboard has a blue backlight 
probably have other peripherals 
loves this mouse 
husband has told 
Has many functions 
Takes some time 
Weights help it 
that you can program 
it makes it feel 
have all the weights 
it programmed 
programmed the dpi and dpi shift 
use it to play 
Picked this up after my Razer Chroma died 
it made a huge difference 
kids can lower it when they use 
button click 
have no issues 
put the mouse wheel 
mouse could do 
wheel has 
it to spin it freely 
setting for 1 click 
buttons can be customized completely 
operating system 
once I realized my mistake 
downloaded the correct version 
had no issues 
used the Razer Imperator 
lift the mouse pretty high 
it will fit more palm so it is probably better 
who have RGB keyboards 
far I have not had any issues 
lock feels kind 
Awesome mouse , using it right now , it has a breathing option 
which you should !!! 
use 400 DPI setting or lower if you have 
weights helps too 
using 2 
it gives a firmer feel to the mouse , more control 
turn the mode 
this helps a lot 
Buttons help to modify 
a faster feel 
need a faster feel , I just push the other button 
's 2 mode 
scroll up , it comes back down a bit , maybe something 
prefer the classic ticking 
n't control it 
:-RRB- GREAT PRODUCT BUY 
it has 
smooth designu can shift speed easily 
i have ever had 
programmable buttonsit has 
liked this one 
it comes down 
use a profile 
Forward and back buttons set for surfing , refresh button 
buttons are also set 
tried many , many mice 
fit the nuances 
i even got one 
i have 4 
that does n't mean 
edit the DPI 
It glides smooth 
has the adjustable weights 
Got this mouse for gaming and damn , I ca n't explain 
other mouse would cramp my hands 
spent $ 60 on cheaper gaming mice , thinking 
finding a replacement 
Eventually I ordered the G502 
fabulous in my lady sized , palm gripping hand 
mouse feels 
Buy this 
just buy it 
This kicks my old ratz 9 butt 
liked this product because it is very useful 
It is helping 
do alot 
gave it 5 stars 
put in all the weights the bottom part would n't close properly 
now I ca n't use all the weights 
mouse moves too fast 
using some applications 
adjust mouse speed 
n't forgotten a thing when it comes 
weights allow you to customize 
how it feels 
it glides 
handle is perfect 
consider this 
Amazing mouse , works just as great 
It feels great 
awsome grabyou can control mouth weight 
buttons may cause misclicks 
made a night 
lot of others do as 
what to expect 
never spent so much 
what to expect 
weight feels right even without having 
felt the buttons 
It took a hour or so to get 
not have the slightest bit 
using a wireless mouse 
mouse just feels more responsive 
it feels 
made this mouse 
that I have ever owned 
Maybe a few more hours will solve the problem 
n't , then you do n't own a G502 
mouse IS THE BEST mouse 
now bought 4 
Logitech can make more ergonomic gaming keyboard 
buy againA 
enjoy it

Does everything unwanted 
Was literally plug 
rate it up there 
picked this up as a temporary mouse , thinking 
it 's going strong 
Fantastic lighting options , amazing integrated software , and flawless DPI switching makes this a go-to recommendation 
that needs mouse-based macros 
that they included 
Ive had this for a few weeks now 
have no complaints 
old red dragon mouse was giving me scrolling issues 
purchased this 
only thing I had to say was annoying 
small CD install disc 
tower has the CD/DVD reader sideways 
that suddenly stopped moving 
Buttons are nicely laid 
received this two days ago 
that I would recommend 
stars said it 
Awesome mouse my kid loves it 
Best mouse i have ever had 
ive had it 
not tell the difference 
easily spent half as much 
Well the more expensive brands seem to have 
it move quickly around the screen while out of game can use 
had this mouse for over a year now 
Unfortunately mine was missing some weights 
Fortunately , they make little difference 
It has a braided cable 
Gives it a premium feel 
colors show up better 
that let 
rebind keys 
leveling up abilities 
use it 
still have an 4 keys 
that are n't used 
It also has a macro function 
set it 
that works well 
It has a little lip 
have 6 
go?You should buy this 
enjoyed it 
works great for the bit of mmos gaming I do and the thumb buttons are great 
girlfriend loves this 
loves it 
Used this mouse 
which allows my hands to rest 
left and right click on the mouse have the rough , sand-like design 
which makes clicking 
get a new one 
coating starts to wear 
now and it really feels great 
had it 
it looks messy so now its time 
which failed 
Had a razer naga 
naga did 
using this for about 6 months now its great for less than half the price does 
Easy set up , good feel 
Odd getting used to if your not used 
who has been looking 
change the color 
choosing pink/purple colors , the scroll wheel takes 
This also happens when choosing 
Additionally , you can customize the brightness of the LEDs , set 
change the breathing speed 
mouse comes pre-assembled 
customize the weight 
It feels heavy 
who prefer lighter mice 
key on the keyboardExecute macros set up in a built-in macro editorPerform basic PC functions such as copy/paste , select all , and printPerform advanced functions 
that allows you to adjust 
that allows 
mouse has nice , rough texture 
It also came 
have small hands 
Those with average sized hands should have no trouble 
accessing those buttons 
honestly ca n't say enough good things 
long it will last 
update this review if I encounter 
this edged out 
comparing prices 
browsing the internet 
had no issues holding and picking up with pinky and thumb while using 
shape of the mouse feels natural 
top buttons feel solid 
have a tactile click 
form valleys 
found the extra top button to be an interesting addition 
which can be switched quickly 
mouse has five active profiles 
profile has a customizable led color , button action -LRB- key , key combo , and macro -RRB- , mouse movement and DPI settings 
removable weights in the mouse do n't give a large weight range but the mouse weight itself is enough 
recommend it 
using the razer naga 
it was starting 
making an upgrade 
even pick custom colors 
press the side buttons 
this completely beats any other MMO mouse out there 
definitely recommend this mouse 
getting a GREAT deal 
weights enhance game play almost ten fold -LRB- if your willing to take your time to learn which works for you -RRB- , being able to swap from different prefs with a click of the button , adjusting mouse speed mid game without the use of a menu for situational needs , not to mention the biggest feature , the keypad , it 's placement is perfect , and if you 're new to the idea of a keypad on your mouse , do n't worry , it 's INCREDIBLY easy to adapt to , As easy as riding a bike , the only problem would be your willingness 
which works 
not to mention the biggest feature 
have an irreplaceable gaming mouse 
it needs to be calibrated 
changing the settings to meet 
that you can just plug in 
swap prefs 
use it for all my pc gaming to reduce 
everything else gets mapped 
use the keyboard 
set those 
used to it , anything else will seem 
It took a bit of getting used to because I had previously only used 
had this mouse 
had no problems with it and it has held it own 
it has held it 
son loves it 
durable cord cloth lined 
have smaller hands 
suggest it 
who have cocain 
purchased this mouse to relieve 
it has done just that 
which has come in handy so far depending on the surface I 'm using 
n't tell my boss 
only had this mouse 
It works great , easy to use gui on the software , the buttons work 
mouse does feel a bit light to me -LRB- this is my first `` gaming '' mouse -RRB- so that is taking 
sensor will help to make 
strongly recommend it 
why I would ever need so many buttons 
mouse looks cool 
Took a little 
son likes it 
Ok , So I bought this mouse 
it saves me so many clicks 
use it 
saving about 2 hours 
paste actions alone 
it throwing it into my laptop bag once 
it performs 
only had it 
it fully weighted 
pointer has 4 speed settings 
keep it 
mouse feels nice and heavy in your hand when you 've got 
it lacks a backwards and forwards button on the side , for when I 'm not gaming 
buttons can take a while 
actually prefer that 
It also comes 
It has an almost rubber feeling 
preventing my hand from getting 
giving it a good grip 
It has a nice weight 
definitely buy this mouse again 
had it for about 2 weeks now 
use this 
need my work 
buy me one 
never used a mouse with weights in it before 
know people who like to use them in their 's , so it 's cool 
it has the option 
strain certain fingers 
having the added weight 
Ever since WoW made it 
having it 
set it to for however I feel 
it has a thumb rest 
mouse started off all red 
which is put there 
button on the left side of the left click 
it feel a tad bit cheaper 
which makes 
it !? 
None of that will affect your gaming now 
that will hold the weights 
playing wow never felt so comfy until I got 
now I can do all the commands 
used my mice 
it looks so much cooler 
not mentioned the colors 
it continues to provide 
Been using it for almost two years and it continues to provide not only great performance in MMO 's , but all PC games , at a fraction of the price Razr or Steelseries expect 
Ca n't beat the price 
using this mouse for months now 
it has n't failed on me once 
DPI will occasionally reset 
used this 
mouse might not perform 
it does 
have all 
how you can adjust the weight 
mouse feels really comfortable 
that I paid a lot 
have the keypad capability 
using it 
mouse tracks incredibly well 
have some tables 
not needed it 
where I have traditionally needed a mouse pad 
that I might have 
that my old Naga had 
not counting the keypad portion 
use the software to reassign 
using this mouse 
It feels great 
using this mouse 
accidentally bumped the USB part of the cable when it was plugged 
it started to turn 
took very good care 
it started to do 
eventually it stopped turning 
USB port I plugged it into 
when I called the provider 
purchased an extended warranty when I bought 
this worked well 
which I thought 
replacement was sent 
new mouse seems to be working 
that I think 
selection now changes 
glow as well , and the texture of the mouse itself has changed 
braided cord feels more durable 
which caught 
Previously it had a smooth grip texture 
new one has a rough/grainy texture 
which I really liked 
mouse had before 
read some of the previous views as 
controller should not break 
never used a Razer mouse 
n't really play competitive online games 
use a lot of skills quickly 
wanted a quality mouse with tons of side buttons to make 
mouse has worked out perfectly 
buttons may be considered a bit squishy 
thumb develops the muscle memory to use 
not have quite as much control 
not had much experience using 
have control over 
it 's also just aesthetically pleasing 
it helps 
need a new gaming mouse 
who are considering a customize-able gaming mouse 
mice track 
chalked it 
mice still feel a bit clumsy 
longer missing icons 
mouse fits like a glove as if it was custom tailored 
fingers fall exactly in the grooves and contours of the mouse and my thumb rests 
expected a learning curve 
have no problems at all selecting 
get the most accuracy 
replace razer naga i 
any and i mean any color 
want it to be 
hot keys took some time 
how to map them the way 
i got it 
use it 
build quality 
's an adjustment period any time 
new mouse and your hand is used to sitting 
Ca n't go wrong 
adjustable as far as the multicolor lighting and programmable buttons go 
bought this mouse to replace 
that I had been using 
It fits nice 
software for button customization works well 
drafting and 3D modeling 
it works well 
use it 
Does everything 
make adjustments 
ledge ' below the side buttons makes 
rest your thumb 
way the 12-key is contoured makes it simple to find 
12-key is contoured 
Lastly , the different mouse speeds make it easy to switch 
recently bought this mouse to play 
have large hands 
adjustable lights and macros make this mouse your mouse 
bought this mouse 
Only been using it 
angled buttons make it very easy to find 
does a lot 
really likes this product 
n't play games 
whatever you need to do 
Who needs to go 
mouse , but any gamer can appreciate the extra key bindings available 
This says 
enjoying it a lot for MOBAs actually 
then still have dance 
hit 1-6 
brings some great option 
It looks good 
n't regret this buy 
use hotkeys 
have high DPI 
has amazing performance in-game 
mouse looks great 
that had number keys 
mouse seemed like it fit 
gave it a shot!So 
Mouse effortlessly glides 
also included extra glide pads 
not see any issues 
not regret it 
Bested my expectations 
Feels very high quality 
Recently purchased one to replace 
does everything 
job done 
having a unique texture 
buttons having a unique texture makes it easy to get 
All in all would definitely purchase again 
makes it very versatile 
mouse fits very well 
bind macros 
adjustment works great 
useing this mouse 
i like it ill just use it 
it moving 
who are considering buying 
minimize the amount 
many buttons on the side made keybinds for casting 
visually it just looked so bawse 
now i just wanted something different 
i figured 
what else would beat this great mouse 
user i figured what else would beat this great mouse in looks and performance other then a newer edition Naga ... then i saw the pricing 
again i do care 
most of their `` MMO '' mice were not too pleasing visually 
looking up reviews i 
man am i so glad i tried it 
mouse has an 
it sticks to the hand well 
which help 
compare the feel 
angled side button feel great 
Dpi can get 
what most might use tbut 
it can be changed 
thing even has removable weights 
that can be taken out to lighten 
effect can be speed 
rest feels so comfortable 
All in all this mouse is FREAKING AMAZING , and again 
mouse literally has every feature 
current Razer Naga has right down 
has weights 
Naga for some reason does n't have this 
that can be changed 
LEDs in the individual numbers buttons , wheel and logo on the Razer can be changed to mix 
considering the prices 
's absolutely NO reason 
gamer who keybinds should n't want this mouse 
who keybinds 
It goes toe to toe with the the best MMO mice out there 
feature of weights and its super low price point trumps Razer easily 
then BUY THIS MOUSE 
ever used a mainstream gaming mouse 
want something new 
care about that 's also under 100 $ 
think higher price = better then please , buy this mouse ... because once in hand you 'll see 
how its changed your experience 
ever thinking extra money ment 
easily get a nice XL mouse pad 
what anyone else is selling mice 
few good games off steam or hell maybe even order a pizza with wings and a case of monster because you made 
writing reviews 
ill tell my friends 
other gamers know 
option exist 
review i know 
item arrived ahead 
recommend this mouse 
who plays MMORPG games 
write a review 
play FFXIV 
it does everything 
it advertises and goes above 
what a gaming mouse should be 
buttons on the side makes things super convenient 
access your hot bar 
It definitely makes a difference when 
heavy you want your mouse to be 
mouse performs so much better 
It fits in my hand perfectly 
where the row between 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 sits 
liked the most about this product .1 
use this mouse 
extra keys on the side and the comfort of the grip have upped my game tremendously 
Used it 
using a gaming pc 
that you download 
app that you download to your computer has tons 
Dpi has an extremely wide range 
change dpi by pressing 
bought this mouse 
later the laser stopped working 
weeks out of warranty , Utech sent me another replacement 
profile has different color so you can easily remember 
that gets 
job done 
that do n't want to spend 
even prefer this one 
friends have 
Previously used a Naga 
it 's performing 
Got it 
using this product 
it has n't caused me one fault 
that comes with it is flawless 
took the time to set 
profile I 'm using 
many keys at first , as I played I realized some stretching key 
many of those I can solve by setting the mouse to hit those key binds 
experience worked great , seamless responsiveness , even though I did n't bind 
switching weapons/tools 
which is typically solved 
which does n't take too long 
Pressing the number buttons 
cost you all 
which worked great 
switching is slowed down tremendously 
who had already scrolled 
pull it up faster 
pulling up the gun 
that counter strike runs on , therefore , acts 
who do n't know 
simply highlights it 
where the number press was accompanied 
solved this by simply making another profile where the number press was accompanied by a click afterwards , making 
nothing beats it , great job Utech 
feels premium 
It works 
some getting used 
n't have a disk drive 
how you can adjust the weight 
definitely be recommending it 
using it 
So I actually bought this to use 
bind a lot 
also use it 
However , you can program ALL THE BUTTONS 
quick fire button that 's located on the side of the left click 
have 100 dollar mice 
that do n't feel this great 
replaced both 
DPI is better controlled 
mouse feel the perfect weight 
It comes 
that you can take out if it 's too heavy 
buttons are pretty much set 
buttons feel great 
dumped all my other mice 
replacing all 
put our hands 
not to mention the pretty much 
ordered a the right time 
told the people 
replacing Logitech 's top mice 
That 's

reviewers say 
using Razer Nagas 
saw this mouse 
it looked promising 
buttons work great 
It feels solid 
It has a great grip 
customize the weight 
program does n't seem to have 
really enjoy the buttons on the top to change 
long warranty and UtechSmart provided 
side buttons are mapped 
bought it for my husband to use 
This has so many color options 
match his keyboard 
has a lot 
use it daily 
that you require 
which in turn has helped tremendously with using 
extra groove for the ring finger has helped 
it can go down to 50 dpi so anyone going 
low will certainly enjoy it 
makes work so much easier 
bought this mouse because I have 
each have their own fault/failures 
had a Razer Naga MMOG mouse 
that I loved 
n't have the $ 80 bucks 
left button on my naga gave out and I did n't have the $ 80 bucks I needed to replace it , so I settled 
mouse actually fits my hand much better 
one also has a small shelf 
that really comes in handy for me when precision is key 
Aesthetically , I prefer the look of the Utech , as the customization is MUCH more in depth and the software is a lot less naggy 
change dpi adjustments 
wheel on this feels more responsive 
actually prefer this 
it feels sturdy 
had a Razer gaming mouse 
mouse collects dust now 
razor finally gave 
carefully considering a few other highly rated options 
mouse itself feels amazing 
It has a matted / textured feel 
it beat 
Naga has 
Additionally , after about a month the * 6 * side button stopped working 
fixed the issue temporarily 
Then it happened again 
which I have been using 
That being said 
immediately replaced the product 
contacted Utech 
build quality 
had the mouse for about 2 years now 
Never have had any problems 
particular mouse has many strategically placed buttons 
People with larger hands will find the side buttons very easy 
recommend the Uranus mouse 
what drew 
play a lot 
almost eliminate the need 
researched this mouse 
Loves it 
keys work as described 
create a double click function 
edit almost every button to do 
which you can find 
change weights 
It looks 
that I need 
have a great feel 
that I set 
i have ever had 
tried all 
It competes 
contact started getting 
it lasted 
buying this mouse again because I can not live 
Purchased for my son the avid gamer 
loves it more 
bought it 
It has the right amount 
it does a great job when we are playing 
that can be removed to suit 
n't see anything better 
nags run double the price 
recommended this mouse 
even be buying one 
not recommend this mouse enough 
it 's just missing removable weights 
software included 
never had a mouse 
make this mouse ideal 
customizable DPI settings make this a one push button 
then I press one button to drop 
braided cable attached to the mouse make me confident 
it will last 
n't found anything better 
modes keep 
Just got the mouse 
it works much better 
software installed fast 
Now having it 
mouse is not smooth 
wheel is smooth 
make the changes 
what you need 
accidentally press it 
have a different layout 
exactly what was described 
returning it 
n't take a star off for that because that 's just the design 
had the original Razer Naga 
It felt like it was literally sculpted 
try it 
finish felt great 
It had a sturdy rubberized finish 
that did n't feel sticky 
it slid very smoothly 
bring this 
returned it 
thing was made 
right index finger would usually push down enough on the mouse button to register 
that distribute the weight of their hand more 
This probably wo n't happen 
Again I ca n't take a star 
mouse was designed exactly as intended 
plays excellent in games due 
players with small hands may run into the same issue as I did 
rest your hand 
way you rest your hand affects this so it comes 
it does fit my hand better 
recommend it 
really have nothing bad 
have a lot 
issues with setup and my windows 10 machine recognized it right away 
some getting used 
product will take 
It glides beautifully 
that quite compares 
not found anything 
That said 
that feels 
drivers come 
have a Surface 
actually , none of my PCs have one 
get to it , it reports as being corrupt 
amazon lets me post this link , because I 'd hate 
anyone would give up on looking 
post this link 
Choose either the second 
post the link 
Everyone loves Macros 
missed it 
When you assign a button 
Just record your keystroke -LRB- s 
much do everything 
adjust DPI scales 
expensive mouse could do 
product seems durable 
that requires you to push 
require a little pressure 
this would make your aim while pressing 
n't expect much when I ordered 
wanted something 
that had side buttons 
now replaced my razor naga 
that I have 
that for some reason causes my hand to start 
has a wonderful price 
far I am liking the mouse 
that did a good review 
video compared the different competitors 
lookup the features 
watch people 's videos before you buy 
far , I would recommend this 
it make it easy to play 
play Black Desert Online 
create awsome combo 
using it 
Ca n't find any flaws 
Great for gaming and CAD/BIM designing 
I wanted 
have one of these to play 
had mine 
it works great 
button on my Naga has stopped 
working on both Naga 's I went through 
feel cheaply made too 
So I got this mouse 
EXACTLY what I wanted , feel is good 
what I wanted 
then there 's the UtechSmart Venus MMO Gaming Mouse 
testing is taking place 
mouse features a full complement 
numbered 1 
ones already on the mouse wear down 
Once you weight the mouse 
spare weights can go 
downloading the latest version 
what I did 
file , so you 'll need something like 7zip to extract 
just follow its instructions 
file starts the UtechSmart 16400DPI Venus Gaming Mouse Setup Wizard 
that allows you to tweak 
finished , you 'll have both the driver 
features include button functions 
use different settings 
Up to five profiles can be stored directly on the mouse , so 
Interestingly , there 's also a small profile button 
that can be used to switch between your stored profiles if you need 
what they 're doing when it comes 
known outside the MMO community , the company clearly knows 
everything responds exactly like you 'd expect 
All of that paired 
Why would you buy any other mouse when this one , with all of its features and quality is available 
use it to play 
This alows me the ability 
primarily use this to optimize 
i use all the time to automate 
bought it 
needed a mouse with buttons to avoid 
found this one 
id try it 
buttons on top , to quickly change the DPI settings without having to tab out of game , is plus 
purchased it 
play my mmo game 
bought one for my cousin as 
change it 
play and use this mouse !! 
does everything 
just surfing the internet 
need it to do 
change the LED colors 
Had this mouse 
give an objective review 
Multifunctional buttons work very well 
Now for the semi negative these are not deal breakers 
area , the last 6 buttons are fairly difficult to reach without adjusting my hand over the mouse to manipulate use , I rarely use them anyways 
layout of the mouse for your mouse 1 and 2 buttons are significantly spaced apart/pointer and middle finger 
find my wrist 
that were mentioned above 
suit your needs 
that takes 
press one 
which for me inherently makes 
It takes a bit 
recommend it 
much it improves your speed by not having 
i have ever owned 
using my standard keyboard 
wont say 
friend recommended a gaming mouse 
abilities changed dramatically 
use it primarily 
It has enabled me to decrease 
control your media more lazily 
it really needs more buttons 
that can DOUBLE 
that would allow dual-typing capabilities 
though , the macros could use to be a little easier 
that does n't really help me open 
how to send strings 
it would do very well 
needed a mouse 
had a Razor Naga before 
that came 
who wanted it 
bought this 
liked it so much 
who also bought one

It does change colors 
that you have to continue

Also each button on the side are slanted 
which makes it easy to identify 
It just takes some time to get

HELPS SOOO MUCH 
that would fit my needs 
Naga , Redragon M901 , and the Logitech G600 and I decided to go 
buttons are perfectly placed so they 're easy 
put my hand on it , it felt like home although I wish 
turn the DPI 
which I am used 
definitely be getting this again if need be 
actually bought this 
doing programming

that would come

Fantastic product thank 
which stopped working 
non-slip surface of the click keys feels better 
put a lip on the opposite 5th finger side to keep 
price on this Razor knock 
switch power-ups 
have no complaints 
bought this keyboard a few weeks after I bought 
it does n't disappoint 
it looks great 
using the solid green lights on both the mouse and keyboard to match 
common gaming macro keys have an extra underline 
Utechsmart really does n't skimp 
highly recommend their products 
This makes my ESO experience much more enjoyable 
Recommend 10/10 
when I saw a review on UtechSmart products online 
mouse had a nice sturdy feel to it so when you are moving 
have no regrets 
buying it 
son was thrilled 
loved it 
apply it 
mouse will require time 
leaving my right hand 
not say the same for my left hand , since the mouse was specialized 
how the wire of the mouse does not feel intrusive to the movements of the mouse , as if it was made 
which I use to affect 
enjoy the ability 
changing the color 
that comes 
change the weight 
appreciate the ability 
adjust the force 
how this feature can help 
Brother in law loves it so glad 
i bought this product 
First of all , my mouse got here 1 day earlier 
which made me happy 
play MMO games , I have found uses 
braided fiber cable and gold plated 
12/10 would buy again 
mouse blew me away 
had the razer mice for so long I feel 
playing mmorpg 
have WAY less strain 
replacing the weight 
Buy this now if you need 
actually use this bad boy 
Now you can have a thumb button 
that does 
that do stuff 
wasting that power 
Well , you can have 12 thumb buttons 
Mouse feels 
that protrudes 
when you lift the mouse 
occasionally your thumb will accidentally press one of the side number buttons since you 're grabbing 
not fault the product 
add weights 
only had it 
It honestly beats out my old $ 80 razer naga mouse anyday 
what each button says 
came to pc games , my usual go to is a razor mouse 
many of you looked there 
which isnt so much 
making it so I was having 
had it nearly 3 months now 
enjoy the color change choices 
i 've ever played 
's a thumb rest 
all but your pinky rests 
recommend this 
once your hand gets used 
It will feel a little funky 
it lasts more than 6 months 
saving lots 
It seems 
bought 2 of these , one 
got this mouse on sale , intending 
It shipped quickly 
that said 
Once I found the software 
lack a disk-drive 
everything worked very well 
that requires 12 buttons 
It makes playing 
that utilize skill bars 
character moving 
hit my skills using 
giving a try 
got it 
set each button 
it work 
wanted something 
got a new mouse 
programmable buttons on the side have a wide range 
really liked this mouse 
change the lighting 
have different angles so it does n't take 
solid click 
bought one 
likes it 
bought my mouse 
Recently though I was having an issue 
wrote the support people 
had a defective mouse 
sent me another one 
fast UtechSmart was at fixing my issue 
So though the first mouse started 
still give it 5 stars 
get a lemon 
have no problem 
recommending this mouse 
last the year then maybe I will change this review 
buying one 
n't bind it 
it causes me to jolt 
which messes me up when gaming 
read instruction guide , extra weights if you prefer 
begin , the mouse comes 
which run Windows OS 
which can be used to adjust 
• Has 
which will essentially make the mouse cord unbreakable • Easy to use 
• Can have a DPI 
smallest movements will couse the mouse on screen to travel 
total of 18 programmable buttons • 
mouse becomes unusable as the mouse starts 
instead has soft clicks 
Driver only works 
which operate 
which run Windows OS • 
mouse itself works perfectly fine 
want to customize the mouse 's settings to use on an Apple machine , the driver must be installed 
this is definitely a must buy 
Mouse works well 
Unfortunately my dexterity with my fat thumb precludes me from operating 
definitely recommend this mouse though 
still use it 
who 'd never owned a gaming mouse before 
mouse exceeded my expectations 
lights on the front do n't always match 
and-The buttons do n't always like to respond when I hit 
just have 2 little nitpicks 
hate it when it happens 
sent me a brand 
wire started behaving 
highly recommend buying from this company , especially this mouse 
used a Razer Naga for the last 5 + years , until very recently 
only mention this 
so i had become very reliant 
i have 
suggest this brand 
colors match anything 
i kept them until they gave 
i 've had 
previous 2 gaming mice i 've had , have felt too big 
how it fits 
It feels very smooth 
i 'd just use 3-4 of the side mouse buttons because i did n't think 
i am getting use 
long this mouse will last 
good mouse have promblem contact email suport 
bought this to replace 
bought something 
beautiful blue light illuminates while I play
