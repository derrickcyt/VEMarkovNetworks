The mouse has not been working correctly

no way to customize the functions of the buttons

Being a longtime user of the Logitech Cordless Trackman
I 'd hoped the M570 Wireless Trackball would be at least
to manipulate with your thumb
it 's rough and jittery compared to

does n't put your wrist at a weird angle like
that leads to hand fatigue trying to use
fatigue trying to use the thing
They feel clattery and cheap
which reflects the overall manufacture of this mouse

worked at all
another failed within six months
I suffered with it for
chucking it out of frustration and fatigue
My low score has nothing to do with
nothing to do with the produce in
ball moves fine
I ca n't use all the features of the mouse
my work controls the control panel
I can feel the pain as I
I use it
I feel it more in
my thumb the more I use
I use it
Trying the handshoe mouse next
fingers crossed
...the product has simply gotten worse
Logitech sent me a replacement

I have no idea how people
to use this thing
It makes my hand cramp up before

I have now owned 4 of these ( 3 replacements )

contacting their support line about the double/triple click issue

it seems
I work in programming/security
use this for 40-60hrs/week
I have never had any issues with other mouse buttons
other mouse buttons failing under these working conditions
the m570s will inevitably fail
Working through the tech support is
you tried changing batteries
cleaning
installing drivers
I wish any of those

I purchased it four months ago
it worked pretty well for the first couple
I 've seen very herky jerky response when using

I tried replacing the battery
it made a little difference for a few hours

that would also help for a while
just bumping it against the desk
the desk would also

all rose to a head today when

I tried

resulting in several pieces. I had
I had a similar experience with a Logitech wireless travel mouse
that worked fantastically for almost a year
it started double-clicking on everything I
I wanted to single click on
I should have learned my lesson
I ended up wasting more money on another wireless Logitech device
I will probably never purchase another keyboard/mouse made by
another keyboard/mouse made by Logitech ( wired or wireless again
I wo n't lose sleep over it

this causes some serious problems depending on
some serious problems depending on the program you

the tracker wheel broke

making the mouse unusable
the mouse has broken
I single click with the left button
the mouse will double click
I thought this must be a random problem
I researched it
I loved the mouse until
it broke
Get what you pay for
you pay for as always
It 's very inaccurate so if you
you do work where you need
you need to finely drag shapes and boxes then
you want to just place a comma between two characters
I ca n't advise it
It 's just so clumsy when
it comes
I liked this mouse

you scroll up just a tiny bit
the page keeps going back down all

you do not need a middle mouse button
having a very smooth spinning mouse wheel is that when
you attempt to press the wheel down
it scrolls unless you

it 's just not going to happen
The wheel will slip
you 'll unclick the button

the cursor feels like it 's running
it 's running through molasses or something
it takes way too many tries to actually click on

I keep missing it

it ) the mouse moves

dies
they will honor their warranty as several

I 'd rather pay a little more for a quality product
I do n't have to hassle with
I do n't like this product

I 've ever owned
it 's about 10 " from the sensor

I 've lost my faith in Logitech
100 % satisfied with this mouse before
the left click stopped working properly after 10 months
the mouse does n't recognize it
holding for dragging or selecting things
it will lose the hold midway
I 'm a little disappointed it only
lasted for 10 months
had to change the batteries
I loved this mouse when I
got it
the left click started going wonky
it got to the point where
they registered at all )
It makes things like clicking and dragging or selecting text impossible
May work OK for most people
not recommended for a work mouse
to flimsy for AutoCad work
liked this mouse

I 've had enough of these unreliable products

it scrolls
it feels like someone is playing
I gave the "freewheeling scrollwheel"
thinking I needed to used to
I needed to used to it
It 's only been three days
it 's gotten steadily harder to scroll to
to scroll to the top of the page
bouncing down a few lines
I feel like I 'm taking
I 'm taking crazy pills here
I think this is how
believe the reports of them
them breaking
to press
I have mechanic hands
the scroll wheel button feels it 's breaking when
it 's breaking when you press
you press it
The back/forward buttons live about where I
I expect
feel enough like buttons
that 's nice
it 's a good medium size
I hear the battery life is
I think that I will not be sticking
to find out
It works great for awhile then
clicks when you only click
click once
I 've experienced this same problem with

I disliked about the 510 including
It clicks quite loudly
I 've owned
you could
click down " on the scroll wheel
it would scroll smoothly
It 's loud to the point
I would n't want to use it if my deskmate
I cannot attest to the battery life as
I 've only been using this a few days
I replaced batteries on it
them worked fine for a while
became very buggy
my first one lasted
it worked as it should
it should for longer than
it does
Time to find an alternative
Logitech should get another vendor for their hyperscroll wheel
I purchased three of these and
these and had to return the first two due to
which results in unintended "automatic " scrolling
depending on how the wheel is positioned
you stop hyperscrolling
use the hyperscroll feature
rely on the hyperscroll feature
I had been using the same mouse for many years
never gave me trouble
I replaced it after the left click button
the left click button became unreliable
I put a lot of use
ca n't complain about having to replace

I 'd kept the original packaging
purchasing this mouse
I looked at other amazon reviews
noticed that there was an issue
a single left click being wrongly registered as a double click
I saw a few comments about Logitech
Logitech replaced the faulty part in the recent version
I bought this mouse in September 2014
I 've been experiencing the dreaded double click problem
to hold and move around while
this unintentional double click issue makes it
it extremely annoying to use
It 's a shame that it
it failed so soon
I put in the included batteries
the green light came on indicating it
indicating it had

I plugged in the included USB

I went away from Logitech
bought an inexpensive EagleTec
it 's better than this
What happened
I do n't know if it
it 's the driver
It seems like it purposely

it does n't move the way you expect
you expect it

I have ever used
It does n't track well
the buttons do not click very good
I 've used a Logitech mouse for years
Not pleased with this mouse
Does n't work well on chair arms

Did not come with CD

Battery cover easily comes off
Tracking drifts left when I move

it bounces around
had to replace it
I 'm fed up
I bought this to replace
this to replace a corded Logitech mouse
I have had many Logitech products over the years
I 've never had a problem until this
I used my corded mouse on
this mouse tracks very erratically
The scroll wheel broke after about a month
began to spin freely
scrolling became erratic too
Product arrived in a plastic bag
arrived broken
responded
uses different accelerations in the two axes
to get used
to .
it felt like the pointer lagged
the pointer lagged every time i moved
i moved it
did n't change anything
it does n't matter when it ca n't track
it ca n't track right
I 've ever used
I would just like to state for
I have their G930 headset
I love
have their top of the line blue tooth keyboard which
I love
I have own many Logitech mouses over the years
I have ever seen
I say that this is
I do n't just mean for the Logitech name
that would want to put their name on this mouse .Do
waste you 're
you 're money
purchase this mouse like I
I did !
!! The scroll wheel is a new design that
that allows you to scroll down
you to scroll down pages supper fast
this does work
I have never scrolled so fast as with
you take your finger off of
it keeps on scrolling
you have to do is get to the link
you want to click on
hold the scroll wheel with one finger
use the other finger to click on
the other finger to click on the link
sometimes just grabbing the mouse will cause
the mouse will cause it
it to start scrolling
you want to go to the very top or bottom of
you get there
let go of the wheel it just
starts to scroll down.This is the hardest mouse I
I have ever had the misfortune of using
ca n't get over that Logitech actually let
let this go out of
this go out of the factory
do a google search about the scroll wheel
you will find this is a very common problem
a very common problem experienced by most who
who buy
I purchased this mouse was because of
I read in a computer magazine
They listed this as the best mouse
who wrote this review never tried
tried out the mouse
I hate this mouse so much that
purchasing this mouse I purchased
I purchased two other mouses
they work GREAT the way a mouse
a mouse should work

I use daily

this one should fail

I 'm fairly confident the batteries have
the batteries have very minimal capacity

I paid for this
I will look to other brands next
I bought it
I did n't damage it
stopped working all by itself
I had to buy another one in another store
it came shipped with the mouse buttons out
I clicked them back in
do n't think a new product should require a customer
a new product should require a customer to fix
a customer to fix it
using it
this reinforces the idea that the mouse
the mouse embodies shoddy
It functions as a mouse
It clicks
it scrolls
it moves around the screen
it makes a horrible high pitched whining noise that you
you can ignore until you
you realize it
it 's happening
all you can hear for the rest of
it works
Does n't work at

bad product to arrive thought it is same
i want my money
looks good
you 're in a really quite room
you 'll notice there 's
there 's a very faint
it makes the whole time you 're moving
you 're moving the mouse
I returned it immediately
The all-important left button stopped working after 18 months
looks completely different then the photo
I have replaced it
the scroll wheel does not work
the mouse makes a faint continuous whining noise as
it runs
would not buy
you move the mouse
it makes a faint buzzing noise
the red optical sensor brightens
it vibrates and makes the noise
A must return
I bought this mouse in October
stops working
Won't do anything
starts back up again
it has been more then 3 months I ca n't return
I ca n't return it
that does not work
Do not waste your money on this product
the mouse registers movement it beeps
it beeps until
it stops moving
annoying
Clicking and scrolling is
it fits the palm well

Taking the mouse apart it can be fixed

the mouse costs too much for Logitech
that allows the mouse wheel to either

you can technically fix the problem by opening

re-positioning a little rubber ring that 's held in
that 's held in place by
rendering the mechanism useless
it requires removing the mouse slider pads
getting into the internals of the mouse
I have had two of those
them have had the same problem after about 12-18 months.The problem
the scroll wheel tends to drift as you
you move the mouse
it 's so sensitive ).All in

I found that
It did n't pair with my logitech bluetooth

I know what you are thinking

they wrote seems to be only functional depending
no way to know what bluetooth dongle to buy

I read
Their website does n't work in my favorite browser , firefox
I tried it in the microsoft one
that fails
to get to the chat support because of microsoft edge pop-up blocker
I turned off the pop-up blocker
still did n't get it

that would help out either. I could have bought
either. I could have bought a non-bluetooth mouse for less

I 've had the issue on several computers
several computers )
The battery seems to die after a few days use
a few days use now
gets stuck
I 'd give it a 1 star
this thing to last more than a year
considering its a top-of-the-line product
I have the logitech mx mouse
it 's the best
the MX Master BUT...it would not stay connected via bluetooth or using
bluetooth or using the receiver
Would work for 5 minutes then cut
cut off
had to restart everything
Went to Logitech 's website
saw in their help forum many
many had the same problem
it being able to stay connected I
to stay connected I could not give any more than 1 star since
I could not give any more than 1 star since it
it does not work as intended
I 'll order that one
one to replace it
I had the older version of this mouse
needed another for a new computer
The older model has been discontinues
liked that it had bluetooth capability
it had bluetooth capability as I
I have a mac air with limited usb ports
that make this mouse not worth the upgrade
I had to go back to using
using the 2.4Ghz dongle for good performance
I got it I thought
I thought it might be
I noticed this change I though
only a month went by and boom , electronic scroll control button no worky
Combined
these two items convinced me to leave a less
me to leave a less than commending review
You may have better results
DO NOT PURCHASE this mouse if you
you wish to use via the Bluetooth connection it
a problem Logitech has been aware of for
has failed to address.The mouse works fine via the included USB (universal ) dongle
that does n't exactly help if your computer only
has USB-C ports
Noisy with poor control
I purchased this mouse after having
having great success with logitech in
Be ready for a disappointment if
you purchase this thing
Horrible to use with OS X
the left button tend to double click when I
I perform a single click
It 's still under the warranty
logitech did n't let me repair or replace
me repair or replace the defective product
It ca n't keep a connection over bluetooth
I ca n't continue to use it
definitely would not recommend it to anybody else
do n't have any of these problems
the connection drops all the time
to get the device
the device to reconnect
it ca n't maintain a connection
the issue based around its scrolling wheel .First
the headline implies
extreme sensitivity means that when you
you move your finger upward to scroll
to scroll the page down
touches the wheel ever so slightly
scrolls the window THE OTHER WAY
breaking your concentration completely
spinning " scroll wheel
takes a lot of getting used to--unlike
getting used to--unlike any other mouse you
you 've ever used
( i .e
it will spin for a good 30 seconds
you let it go with a good push )
I 'm
it 's very strange .The other issue
other issue has to do with the build quality
to do with the build quality of this--expensive!--mouse
you use it
you make a sudden mouse move
you feel like you are moving
My five-year-old Logitech travel mouse worked better
ca n't register
ca n't make the dam thing work as described and there registration is
I loved this mouse
the scroll wheel has broken

Be aware that
Manufacturer refurbished with 90 days warranty

the ratcheting wheel stopped working
it requires me to take it
me to take it apart to fix
to fix it
This mouse does n't work correctly over Bluetooth (
opposed to the Logitech USB dongle ) on macOS.
you will have to power cycle the mouse
Logitech support confirmed it is
instructed me to return
me to return it
I did
suggesting a fix may be
it will continue to move on its own
moves when
touching it by simply moving
moving the mouse
I have owned many other Logitech mice
crashes on my new Mac
the solution offered by Logitech support is
to have me repeatedly restart the computer
restart the computer until
it works
works with multiple computers .However
works great for 37 months
the buttons start failing
the build quality inside the mouse
I got mine then 2 days
my battery stop working
I could n't charge it either
I have to wait a week to get
a week to get a new mouse
No acceleration control! The mouse has some
The mouse has some sort of
hardware controlled acceleration function
You cannot disable it
you cannot control it
Logitech does not give any attention to the user forums and requests
received the mouse from Amazon
struggling for the last 5-6 hours to find a setting combination
the last 5-6 hours to find a setting combination that
that would work
you cannot bypass the annoying accelaration thing
it will cost you serious time until
you adjust the settings to bypass
the settings to bypass its built-in acceleration
you do n't have any control on the accelaration
You cannot select small things on the screen
you use normal or high speeds
you lower the pointer speed then it
it gets extremely slower
you can hit the small things
the acceleration does not slow down in the same ratio
find your pointer at weird places on
I learned ( of course
buying this thing ) that this
this thing ) that this has been
this has been an ongoing issue for I
I do n't know how
Logitech did
anything to fix it
which tells you actually something
something :They do n't know how to do
:They do n't know how to do that
to do that ! !Be
that ! !Be careful
I say
I purchased it expecting

I have been using the MX Master for a little
I waited soooooo long to have the MX Revolution next
to have the MX Revolution next in class
That mouse lasted me years of
lost it 's left
it 's left mouse click
I loved that mouse and for
made a replacement in the line so
I had to switch to a stupid gaming mouse to get
a stupid gaming mouse to get that awesome functionality of
to say I was very excited to get
Let me first say there
say there are a couple of
which did n't change or improved upon from the MX Revolution
's what I loved about
I loved about the MX Revolution that
the MX Master has failed to live up too
did they mash the thumb scroll
I got used to it
I liked that the thumb wheel also
acted as a push in button
no dumb button hidden under the thumb rest that
that does n't work after 10 uses
the MX Master does not play nice with Excel
the MX Revolution used to
did n't work
Lame lame lame lame lame lame
I would n't mind the price tag
it does n't live up to predecessors
even half what I
I paid
I paid full price
I remember watching the video for the mouse

I used the original MX for approximately 7 years
loved it
I use my mouse so much
I went through three of

I decided to "upgrade

wanting to upgrade was because of the advertised advanced features
the ability to connect to multiple computers without
I have the MX Master
I try to implement it 's
it 's new features
I feel like they are
To add to the disappointment
the mouse does n't feel as comfortable as the original MX.
It 's slightly higher/bigger than the original MX.
I realize you
you can (
) customize it to your liking
you switch between smooth scroll
ratcheted scroll
jumps and sounds bad
I try to zoom in with the smooth scroll
keeps going

It 's rather annoying

Suffice it
it to say
Logitech slaps an " MX" on a mouse
other mice Logitech has had over the years
it 's got an unusually-high hump around where
which does n't make for good gripping area
The previous Performance MX has a more smooth profile .Secondly
to use and install
it 's a bit of a letdown
a letdown considering that lower-grade mice like the M705
the M705 do n't need any kind of software help
software help to allow them to function
depressed
I 'm a gamer
I find this VERY disconcerting
I use the "back " mouse button
first-person shooters to have my character move backwards
I tried to use the button bound to
the button bound to that on
my character would maybe take the slightest , briefest step backwards
To most folks
it 's very disappointing
a top-tier product to deliver the same kind of functionality
I 've expected out of Logitech products
the Master does not deliver
I 'm aware this is
even SetPoint had the option to have those thumb buttons
the option to have those thumb buttons act like
those thumb buttons act like they would
they would without the software
it 's rather obtuse
one must set the thumb buttons to
the thumb buttons to "generic button " mode
They will still act EXACTLY the same
They wo n't even work on the Master without
has a very nice feel to use in
a very nice feel to use in the click-to-click ratcheting mode
higher Logitech mouse does , but in adaptive and free-spin modes
the wheel feels far more restrained
when compared to a mouse such as the Performance MX or G700s
I 'm not expecting the wheel to feel like
the wheel to feel like it 's constantly got
it 's constantly got some sort of
I 'm expecting that thing to spin 'til
that thing to spin 'til the cows come
the cows come home
I 'd describe the wheel 's lack of
it being
you 're obsessed with mouse gestures
you 're like me
do n't usually bother with gesture controls
I 'd suggest you do n't waste your money
you do n't waste your money on an MX Master
go for something like a G700s
you can find a good used one
you 're crazy
you might stumble upon an MX Revolution for
to make a G602 with the G700s 's dual-mode scroll wheel
they 'd have the perfect mouse for a power user.Sadly
that ai n't gonna happen.The TL;DR version
do n't buy this
get an M705
you 're
G602 if you

he loves it
that bad to hold and use

when held
I learned when using it to configure a Performance MX

it 's annoying that a mouse this expensive
this expensive would require software life-support to function
SetPoint also both have a bad habit
both have a bad habit of gimping
gimping the scroll wheel 's side scroll functionality
's "general consumer " software has some kind of annoying habit
that reduces mouse functionality unnecessarily .EDIT 1/25/17
I can safely say that
I own both
use
DO NOT BOTHER with the MX Master when
there 's better stuff from the same company
I worked out that side-scroll and thumb-button BS
you 're crazy
you *WILL* need SetPoint to get the most

it would work better
I switch back to my old wired mouse
I do n't understand why they have to use
they have to use their " Mary Casmir " auto-reply
the auto replies have some human typing within the reply
they do n't just have a human do
a human do it
They have decided that my mouse
I 've given them my address
wanted my phone number
I 'll keep updating as this plays
this plays out.EDIT
Logitech stated in an e-mail that
I would get another e-mail with a prepaid return label
has been 48 hours
what has happened to Logitech
9-2-16It took two weeks to get a UPS label
two weeks to get a UPS label to send it
a UPS label to send it back to
it will take longer than usual
I get another mouse with the same problem
I get a new or referred MX Master
I will report when/if
it arrives
it down to one star
I hope to bring to 5 stars once
I get a replacement.Edit
I got a replacement about a week
working on a project
waited
I changed
Bluetooth does not work
do n't care at this point
It 's software , not hardware that is
they need to put out two different versions for
they should .On top of all
they want to close my issue
I think I got one e-mail
I got one e-mail from a real person
Have the balls to state it
the balls to state it does n't work and fix
it does n't work and fix it
own it
fix it.As of
I will never purchase another Logitech product because of this experience
you might want to take this
your product listing too
it 's going to give Amazon a bad rep for
I had an old Logitech MX which I
I used heavily for years
getting sick of fighting
fighting the failing battery
upgrading to this.At first I
do yourself a favor
you 're not surpised when the wheel starts to slip
the wheel starts to slip after a few weeks
It 's still usable it
feels kind of off.Considering the quality issues
I 've had with this
I 'm really wary of buying
buying anything
The cursor jumps all over the place
a full charge lasts about 4 hours
relly makes it hard to work
to work with
to say about the logitech customer service that
Ratchet mechanism failed as in many other reports
Logitech has no good information about this problem
that show how it
it happens
to fix it
I see no point to having to go
having to go through this so I

broke after a month of moderate usage
The device and software have obvious issues with a jerky and sometimes unresponsive cursor
Check the net for yourself it
it 's well documented
having such good luck with Logitech before
I did n't do my usual research
which to me means they
me means they knew
they knew about
shipped it anyway
I guess it 's back
it 's back to my old worn mouse
I find a worthy successor
you Logitech fix the problem
Do n't buy this.Initially
I liked it
I gave this one star was because
It came with a dongle USB
have ability to connect
ability to connect Bluetooth
It 's
people complaining they are unable
to keep this mouse connected via bluetooth
this mouse connected via bluetooth under
has not admitted this problem
this problem exists
I do not think they plan to address it
they plan to address it as far as
I can tell
they ca
they should not advertise this as a bluetooth Mac OS compatible
' Logitech Options '
All attempts failed so it 's
it 's impossible to change
to change the scrolling direction
to add functions to fast keys now
I run on Windows 10 does not save
Windows 10 does not save the customization settings
This means I ca n't customize any
I ca n't customize any of the mouse buttons/wheels
I have 2 of these mice
both exhibit the same problem. I 'm hoping
I 'm hoping this is a simple software issue
Logitech will fix soon
I find a solution
I will update this review
I cannot get this to stay paired with
this to stay paired with my macbook pro
2 other wireless mice have no issues
quality seems decent
I expected
which put my wrist in an uncomfortable position
you bump anything like your keyboard
it clicks unintentionally
to click unintentionally
you hold it
it did not make me more productive like
I hoped
only slowed me down
I gave it a week adjusting
a week adjusting my position
trying to utilize the extra features
It started out ok
the scroll wheel began to scroll on its own
Did some research
found out its common for Logitech mice
Logitech mice to have this problem
Tried all software fixes
plugging the receiver into the back of
caused severe skipping/lag
Ended up plugging it into
up plugging it into my usb hub
Resolved the skipping/lag issue but not the scroll wheel issue
Had to stop using it
purchase another mouse
it being past the 90 days
Lesson learned
the mouse feels really great
I bought this mouse from marked
marked it as
I disagree
the ratchet scroll does not work properly
I received
properly working MX Master Mouse .Although the aesthetic condition of
I would argue that this " Item does not work
this " Item does not work perfectly in every regard
The mouse has a nice design
feels comfortable in your hand
I have is that the pointer
skips across the screen while
using it
I have never had a mouse do
a mouse do that before
I do n't know why is
the cursor keeps sticking just as I
I get it near my target
I have nearby that causes the cursor
the cursor to stick
I 've gone back to using
using the Apple mouse that was to be replaced by
do n't have nearly the same " sticking " problem
This Logitech mouse has been a big disappointment
to get this to connect through
this to connect through Bluetooth
I did it
it would not stay connected
a few minutes ( Windows 10 64 bit )
I have several off brand as well as
these have any problems
any problems connecting and staying connected
it being a brand name mouse I can NOT recommend
I can NOT recommend this mouse
I would stay away from it
intend to use it with the unifying dongle
buying one with Bluetooth if
you cannot use it
trying another one when I read
I read posts online mentioning
mentioning that other users have had
other users have had the same problem
I 've held my review back on
to give it a fair shot
I purchased mainly to be able
to connect this mouse to two different computers without
needing to re-connect each time
The multi-device connection feature works pretty well
It 's way too small
it 's
I have 2 other Logitech Performance MX mice
I 'm thinking about just using
using them instead
The inability to go forward without needing to carefully press
needing to carefully press the button makes this mouse
the button makes this mouse all but useless
I had the previous Logitech high end mouse (
the previous Logitech high end mouse ( the performance MX)
I feel it 's a step
it 's a step down
I bought here a Logitech MX Master Wireless mouse on
I thought Logitech products
I purchased this mouse at the end
this date has never held a charge for more than a week
I have to charge it every 4 or 5 days otherwise
it wo n't work
I gave it a month usage
to return it as the time frame
the time frame to return expired
Having owned
used several of the MX Revolution contrary to
this IS NOT a worthy successor
the "free spin " wheel constantly floating so that the monitor image
the monitor image floats as well making it difficult if
not completely unproductive to use
it handicapped
what 's the point
only would Logitech release this broken product
they offer no solutions other than
tell users to "turn off
message and help boards ( shame on me
checking )
releasing innovative products that Logitech has become
Logitech has become a second class citizen in this market place
THIS IS A BROKEN DEVICE AS IT COMES OUT OF THE BOX

the middle wheel "free-spin " mode quit working
I sent mine back for
have n't received a replacement
it suffers from a design defect which
which affects the scroll wheel mechanism.Basically the scroll wheel ratchet
the scroll wheel ratchet gets stuck in free wheel mode
renders the mouse wheel completely unusable .The problem appeared
.The problem appeared after just a week
I have returned the mouse

The replacement suffered of the same issue
I wonder if other reviews are
considering the price .Search online for
you will find a huge number of unhappy customers
unhappy customers complaining since early 2015.It 's a real let
addressing the issue
I do n't recommend wasting your time and money on this product
I found it
I lost it in the first two days
it 's get easy to mixed
high priceI would like to return it back but unfortunitly I
I 'm iut of USThank
I ordered this mouse in Dec.
the primary button has already broke
I use it for moderate duty
I do n't play games at all
I 'd think twice if I
It 's sad
This mouse works great when it
it connects
lags
I 've read different forums about this
It seems like when it
there 's some bug that makes
that makes connectivity unstable
The cursor will go crazy at times
I tried connecting using the receiver instead of
problem continues
I 've given too much time for myself
myself to test it
I passed the return time
I wish I 've returned it
I 've returned it soon enough
I wish there 's better product
there 's better product out there
to fit my needs
did n't read the specs carefully enough
I replaced with a Microsoft wired
a Microsoft wired mouse .Regards

they work erratically
It does n't have the chrome trim shown in
the chrome trim shown in the product image
the mouse says it 's
it 's a B100
It came in a beat-up little white box
the packaging shown on the product image
It works
It 's absolutely
I expected from a " Logitech
that 's who actually made
made it
I 'm sending it back
I received is a wrong model
Purchased in Feb
died today
another review mentioned
mine says
I paid for the 'new ' model
ended up with the 'old ' model
works if you jiggle
you jiggle the cord long enough
it enters the top of the USB
it comes to PC mice cords in
Too much strain placed on any one point
will cause problems at that point
That 's just common sense
One would think the cord at the USB plug end
to compensate for this strain. .
this strain. . then again
it lasts
you sell
another product "designed to fail" .For around 10 bucks
around 10 bucks though
it 's no better or worse a deal than
I need to use the mouse
I 'm going to return it.It should be M100
the picture showed
I received a totally different packed mouse
a label said it is
I looked at the back of
I see B100
To make sure
I checked the package of B100
they do n't have many differences in price
set and outlook
you ca n't sell it in the package
the package saying it 's
it 's M100
to read the label on ur mouse
that might gave you different mouse
The scroll wheel does n't work well
it 's uncomfortable in my hand
feels very cheap
like Logitech products
I needed a backup mouse for my office
this does n't cut it
I 'm sending it back for
I 'd avoid this
dragging an item
the mouse will "drop
immediately grab whatever is now under
to say this is very annoying when
you 're working quickly in programs
that require a lot of clicking-and-dragging
you have to replace it every year
The scroll wheel makes a lot of noise
Do n't bother with this one
It 's better to spend
to spend a few more dollars
It did n't even last a month
I received a logitech
Do n't like the double click
I have been using Logitech mouse products for more than a decade
I recommend you avoid
you avoid this one

need an inexpensive mouse for word processing then
you do any serious gaming where the left button

you may say why
I waste so much money when I

Give it a pass

It 's a low quality mouse
Does n't particularly deserve a very high rating

I LOVE Logitech

have come from Logitech
I 've purchased a variety over the decades.THIS
I 've bought mice that did n't fit
that did n't fit my mom-hands that well
downgraded the mouse for that
I bought two of these
Loose Aug 13th) The problem is that
scrolling down ( rolling the wheel
it 's very bothersome
I bought two identical mice at the same time
both have this problem
I 've only used this mouse for a few hours
The scroll wheel has a zipper-like clicking sound which is
you use it in a quiet room
I would n't recommend this particular mouse
it seems comfortable enough
works fine
IT DOES NOT WORK!
I GET A REFUND ? TRULY
Rubber melts just from the heat
mouse becomes sticky
wo n't click after a few months of use
I would not use this mouse if it
The wheel felt as if it
recommended for use in any situation
It fell on the floor
my mice do on a regular basis
I 've had for years
my kids drop all the time have taken
all the time have taken a beating

I 'm disappointed this one did n't hold
this one did n't hold up
worked for about a week
worked sparodically
Went back to my old mouse
the scroll wheel does not work well
it arrived
Great looking
felt good
I got it
it started automatically double clicking
time goes on
causes all kinds of problems
I would expect even a cheap mouse to last longer than 2 months
you do n't use your mouse much
you work with spreadsheets
hang out on Facebook
do almost anything else that is sensitive
to double clicking when you only
want a single click
I suggest you look
you look elsewhere
to return it
I say
Thank you very much
plug n play
fits nice in the hand
feels ok
feels SO cheesey and cheap
it grinds

I felt as if
my hand would cramp
the bright light meant that I had to keep
I had to keep it under something
to get any sleep.

to buy a better mouse
I opened the package both cables on
the mice got cut

Will re-update if anything
anything comes up

I knew it was used when
I bought it
I did n't know is that the seller
the seller stated that it was
the keys would not work
this to use at work so
I did n't mind it
I have the same model for my home computer
I love it
I guess I wo n't be buying used equipment
I cannot trust it
I have had 2 other of these
loved them
They went bad as all things
all things do
I bought 2 more exact replacements
BOTH had to sensitive of mouse buttons
I compared them with my other two
I could n’t even touch the right and left click
they would activate
I called Logitech
the person did not say that they know
they know they had
they had a problem
seemed as though
he knew it
He recommended another keyboard mouse combo
I bought 2 of them
lie too close to the desk counter
don’t have the same tilt
I could n’t use the Logitech Mk550
the new ones aren’t doing so well thus far
it worked
cool features easily accessible right at your fingertips
Purchased in Decemeber
did n't use it until mid-January
random keys stopped responding
had to replace within like a week
The mouse works fine
to use
stops working often
it pisses me

it does n't work any longer than that
the cable broke near the C5/" clover
I examined the cable and on
it says 3x0.5mm
that means the cable is AWG 24I cut
discovered that all the wires inside are
they 're about 0.4 mm
that 's AWG 26
a phone cable wire .The IEC320C5 standard
this plug type specifies a max load of 2.5 Amps.AWG 26 wire
2.5 Amps.AWG 26 wire has a mas Amp rating
that 's still a max of
using such thin wires for mains power

i would have hoped that the build
the build would have been better
the cable fits snugly
the electrical contact to take place
the charger does not work

that worked without this issue for
a burning smell coming out from the charger side end
I have removed this cable
using my previous cord that came shipped with

all these reflect on the quality of
sharing here
I bought 2 of these cords

became exposed
I bought this cable when one
my stock cable broke
I used it regularly for
stopped working
threw out my entire adapter because I
I assumed it could n't be just the cable
I thought to test this cable before I
I threw out the whole kit and kaboodle
It turns out this cable
this cable failed
This power cord had wires exposed on
wires exposed on both ends from
causing it
to work any more in less than two months of
I do not recommend this product
Cord will come undone from my laptop 's power brick
the slightest movement ......Tried this cable with a few different power bricks
You would n't think there is a lot
that could go wrong with a power cord
it failed after about 6 weeks
lasted two weeks
shorted out
I have had many cords through the years
have never had that type of problem before
This cable stopped working within a week 's use
who purchased this same cable also faced
faced the same issue
I have n't received a refund for this even
ca n't figure out where
it wo n't work anymore
I had it for less than a month
It arrived quickly
the plastic coating began to separate from one end of
the cord exposing the internal wires
causing sparking when I plug
I plug it in
I received a 3 foot power cord
I ordered a 6 foot cord
to get the wrong length
I did n't believe the reviewers that said
that said their cords broke in
their cords broke in 3 days
they 're cheap
I ordered two of them
It took maybe a month for the first one
the first one to break
that connects into the "brick
tore
I imagine the wires inside had broken
had broken as well
I chalked it up to
it up to bad luck
switched to the second one

I have been using this cable for a couple
heard some buzzing sound from the cable
I found that
the cable started to melt
I could see a little flame at the spot
I found that while I
it had happened while I was charging
me being close to the cable
my house could get on fire
I cannot believe that people cannot make
people cannot make this simple product safe enough
The cable stopped working within one month of
this doesnt happen with other stuff

I ordered this cable since it
I purchased my Intel NUC.
The cable arrived
the label says it 's
it 's a mickey mouse cable
I would look elsewhere for the cable

This cord sent is useless to
It seems like a hard thing to mess
a hard thing to mess up
they did
The cable did not work upon arrival
I thought it was
I got a spare cable from my laptop
it worked fine
I got out a volt meter
discovered that the internal wires were wired with
them reversed
This could have possibly damaged my equipment
it did
I 've sent it back for
hoping it was
I get one from a different batch
wo n't matter for most people
it does for me
I imagine for most uses where you
need this three prong style of power cord to plug
power cord to plug in
wanted ( and needed for my project ) a flat cable
my project ) a flat cable where all 3 wires
individually insulated
You can see that the cable in
that arrived was a standard round cable with
all the wires bundled inside
I ordered 11 of them
it 's annoying
ordering this product I hoped it
I hoped it was the durable 3-spread wire cable
burn up if even
if even slightly bent
It stopped charging my laptop
burned a hole in itself
I ordered MICKEY MOUSE POWER CORD which has
which has three holes
what i got is a power cord with
FAKE! !

the cord meets the plug seperated to reveal the inner wire
the plug seperated to reveal the inner wire .Very dissapointed with
the inner wire .Very dissapointed with this product
the cable connects to the AC adapter the cable insulation
the cable insulation failed
power to the laptop was intermittent
Cable stopped working the first week
Cheaply made
fell apart at one end
Pay the extra money for a Quality cable
I got to get a new one

it 's dead before a month
It 's
any copper strands can come out
give you a jolt of shock
mishandled
it 's ON.Moreover
the product sent
the one shown in the pic
I got was a cylindrical and not the flat one shown.
I awaited a while
I can write a review
deserves one star.--DON'T

the product to ship and arrive

's prongs has small SCRAPES which
hope it does n't burn
it does n't burn anything

feeling slightly weighty in your hand
not too slippery .However
this mouse falls short

jump the page again. I ended up going back
I ended up going back to my M505
relegated the M525 to storage for
Died after one week
I guess it was made on
I have a similar model that is going
to loose
to control
Did n't care for the narrow mouse
that does nothing
talking about the clicking
way to small for long use
You need mass to be
it starts "hyper-scrolling
it scrolls at a time ...this
it scrolls on a map or something you
you pull up online
I would n't buy this mouse
it 's been going on for over
starting to lose my faith in Logitech
I ordered a lesser model a while back
ended up ditching it
ditching it because
to register triple clicks
I had to remove the battery several times a week to make
a week to make it register with

I upgraded and bought this one ( 'cause I
I 'm a long time fan of Logitech )
I find that I ca n't use
I ca n't use the middle button effectively
does n't "lock in " to the notches
it should
brushing it will make my page scroll
it will make my page scroll one space
I try to middle click to open
middle click to open links in a new tab
end up scrolling the page one jump
missing the link instead
owning it the middle button keeps registering

I try to middle click
I 'm right handed

my index finger to click so if ANYTHING
ANYTHING it should be mis-registering
I try to middle click a link
I end up going back instead ...and then I
I ca n't go forward because the right tilt
the scroll wheel does n't work at all
I 'm going to have to look into another brand
Logitech has officially lost my business
cuts out
which has a bigger USB plugin
to set the middle button to double-click
it does for the M510 model
This renders the mouse useless for
I get carpal tunnel syndrome from double clicking
It 's used
button did n't work
I ordered did not work
did not work properly
I received it as compared
compared to the other two which
they functioned as expected
It appears to me that
the package had been opened
I received still had oils
the left mouse button would not even click as if it was completely broken or smashed
which makes it pretty obvious that
the middle mouse button began activating randomly
Several attempts to clean and reinstall the drivers have done nothing
the drivers have done nothing to alleviate
nothing to alleviate this
I ordered did not come with

Son ca n't even play on it

that requires two batteries
I ca n't recommend this one
the roller ball has stopped working
This mouse worked fine for three months

The scroll wheel would sometimes not work
sometimes scroll several pages with one click
I tried disconnecting and reconnecting
replacing the battery
nothing helped
I contacted Logitech

I have been in contact with
they keep saying they are sending
then keep asking for more information
me to jump thru more hoops

take photos from three angles which
which include a piece of paper
I have wasted way too much time trying to get
too much time trying to get this product
this product fixed or replaced
I have been without a working mouse for

This mouse looked great
I kept thinkink the batteries were dying within
a lose connection apparently
you have to take the battery out
put back in a lot
Would n't buy again
Dropped a few stars
This thing eats up batteries even when turned
when turned off
Skip it .Original Review

many reviewers said
The right click button works half the time
I went back to my Razor
I would gladly pay much much more for
any companies make a similar product with high quality materials
I gave up looking
Razor will make a silent mouse one day

It started with the left click not registering
the left click not registering unless pressing
pressing down super hard
the middle mouse wheel stopped working
Purchased one year ago
many others have mentioned
the left mouse button has begun to fail
It takes several clicks for
it to register
keep in mind it will not last.Off to try
it will not last.Off to try another one
Love the mouse
the left click went out
It has n't even been 30 days yet
It registers one out of
this would have been a five star mouse

I guess I could n't expect much
I could n't expect much for the price
look for a quality mouse somewhere else

Returned it
I 'm sure it would be

I 'm Lefty
the mouse clicks so if your workflow
your workflow involves using the scroll wheel
look elsewhere
clicks repeatedly as
you scroll
dislike how
rolling the scroll wheel
dislike the led red dot at the top of
It doesnt need to be there
it wil lshine a red dot on the screen.God
wish logitech
razer would make a high end silent mouse
This mouse did n't work for me
It came in its retail (
not even the Korean ones I saw mentioned
I saw mentioned by some here
I get no cursor
rebooting a few times I actually saw
saw the cursor once
it did n't move
Plugged my Logitech noisy as hell mouse back
it worked no problem
I tried a few different USB ports
a few reboots ( stupid Windows even tried searching
tried searching for drivers for who
who knows what )
I 'm on Win 7 Pro
know my way around a computer
it 's perfect
I will change this review to
this review to more positive if
I hear back from the seller
This mouse does not work on windows 7
I have to send it back
The mouse worked well at the beginning
the scroll-wheel malfunctioned
to return the item
to warn potential buyers of the real possibility that
this cheaply made item will let them
them down
decides to randomly stop working
The mouse does not track side-to-side ( can only move
side-to-side ( can only move up-and-down )
I returned it for a refund
I could not believe to my ears
I took my backup working mouse
has a deeper voice
this noiseless mouse gives a loud klack-klack-klack
that needed the replacement
the company went out of business )
my wife witnessing just started to laugh at my purchase
( To make it clear
it clear the sarcastic
you have experience with an actually quiet mouse
do n't spend on this one
I can clearly hear clicking noises
cheaply made
buy again
do I recommend you buy it
you buy it either
has almost no functionality other than being
being quiet
Poor ergonomic design means it fits in
it fits in your hand somehow
does n't feel like it was designed for
a human hand holds and uses a mouse
the comfort materials added to the sides of
do not assist your grip at all
weighted bottom combined with inwardly curved sides make
inwardly curved sides make this mouse exceedingly difficult to pick
to pick up
re-align with two fingers
Not recommended for gaming
broke after six months
Got it hooked
it hooked up
used it for 2 minutes
unplugged it
put it in the drawer
The mouse looks nice
functions well until
you try
left click
to get it
it to engage
to work with
takes more effort than what it
the button to work
to return it
I will just store it as an emergency mouse
throw it away when I
I clean my desk ...lol
It works great for a few weeks
it would constantly disconnect and reconnect
became a major annoyance while gaming
I would not recommend this to anyone
it 's a mediocre mouse that only
works good short term
bought the mouse
it fits the shape of my hand
I realized sometimes the mouse would freeze
the mouse would freeze just a tiny bit
affects gameplay like crazy because of
I 'll probably update on how durable the mouse
It worked great until after
it does n't register around 3 of
it 's getting worse
It 's moderately annoying for browsing
It 's been a year
the left click stopped working
this looked like the best , cheapest silent mouse on
Go with something else that wo n't break
that wo n't break on you
I purchased this mouse
used it to play RTS games which
it to play RTS games which involved
which involved a frequent amount of clicking
It served that purpose excellent
I owned this product for five months
the left mouse button went from registering every click
registering every click to registering only 50 %
registering only 50 % of clicks in
I have no idea how many times
no idea how many times I will have to hit
I will have to hit the left mouse button before it
performs that left click .Rather than simply complain
simply complain about it
I decided to troubleshoot
a worn clicker (
which presses the button each time you
you push down on the mouse button )
I disassembled the mouse
inspected the left clicker
it required some filing to flatten
some filing to flatten out
a bump had developed on it
which would cause inconsistent clicking )
I went to put it back together
I gave up on it
stopped using the product
!Going back to a more reliable and simpler product
thank you very much
My window to replace or return ended in January 2014 so
missed their window

Mouse scroll wheel broke after a few months of
I guess I got what
I got what I paid
I paid for
The mouse felt great
I had available at the time
it had one of the quietest clicking and scrollwheel sounds
I 'm in a lot of
It fit well with my hand
had rubber in the right places
I had from the start was
you pick up
set the mouse down ( including
you make as your mouse reaches
your mouse reaches the edge of your mouse pad
you need to center it ) the cursor
it ) the cursor flies to
the cursor flies to the right side of
This made it nearly impossible for
that makes this mouse is called
they do n't really want you to know
you to know that
Do a quick search on the internet for
visit their website
you will see how sketchy this brand
I went there to see
to see if
that would fix my cursor jump issue
the cursor jumping issue made this mouse unusable
I would not recommend it
It works
comes with a nice cable
that causes the mouse to randomly force the pointer
the mouse to randomly force the pointer to go
the pointer to go up
moving to the right the pointer will move
the pointer will move to the left
will cost you in competitive games
hand ended up kinda cramping after hours of
the mouse does not compare to standard
selecting small buttons is
it seems to track in the wrong direction
I may have higher expectations
this mouse did not come close to them
I ended up replacing this with a logitech gaming mouse
posting my review
the company emailed me
offered to return my money for the product
to work with
itself does not warrant purchase
I wish I can return
I can return it
amazon does not allow me
me to return
put it back down
it jumps all over my screen
The DPI works great though so
it gets 2 stars
wouldnt buy again
It fits in hand really comfortably
I ca n't deal with the pointer jumping
the pointer jumping around
I tap this mouse
it would jump ( to the right ) across
This feels like really old day when
we had the ball underneath the mice
they create a new version fixing
a new version fixing this extreme issue
the included disc does not work
Got it
I played around with the driver
Reading other reviews
I feel like this is
I got the bad patch
I want to like the mouse
I may have gotten a defective unit
the mouse jumps whenever you set
you set it down
I tried changing the settings in the driver
that comes with it
the problem remained
company contacted me directly
they care about their customers
this particular product does seem to have an issue
it shows it 's
it 's a hot
miss
I 'd go with more reviewed ,
more reviewed , tried
tested product
I would have giving this a 5 star if the back
It slides left
it slides to the left
contacts the plastic case resulting in it
the plastic case resulting in it sticking
it sticking during each rotation
This came dead out of
I found my spare
moving
Do not buy
Keyboard did n't sync up to my desktop
I threw it away
I received the mouse
the mouse damaged
will not plug into my computer
to top it off I did not find
I did not find this out till the return period
the return period had expired
I bought two of these
I broke the keyboard in half
threw it in the trash
I have a lot of Logitech stuff
Mouse would not connect properly

it said drivers loaded
drivers loaded correctly
Thought it was
it 's
the cord broke in 9 mount time
I ordered a few of these keyboard and mice combos
the box and not able to return it because
the return date had passed
I wish they were able
to replace the mouse since the keyboard

It 's a different key each time
dirt obstructing the contact
I would not get this again
Had to replace after 18 months
I missed the window to return
the window to return this item
I 'm stuck with it
Craigslist to get rid of it
Had to repair the mouse to make it
the mouse to make it usable
that holds it together
ordered by mistake
Need to return
I purchased were not assembled completely upon
receiving them
so this must have been a manufacturer issue
love these products because they
I would recommend just buying the keyboard separate because
Not "whisper quiet "
I will also add that the box was n't shipped
it does save on unnecessary materials
it did look like a return rather than
to reinforce the box
keys wear out in less than a year
the keyboards .Not returning
will suit my needs for now
the keyboard works ok
the mouse keeps becoming inactive which is
I returned two of this model
ended up spending a little
spending a little more
got a upgraded Logitech
It 's flimsy
Does n't work most of the time
Cords get in the way
I have nothing good to say
to say about this
to say that now that I
I 've tossed the thing at least it
not whisper quiet
I cannot use it while being
being on a call
it says compatible with Mac
you ca n't keybind the fire button
that gets accidentally pressed all the time while I
I 'm gaming
sending me out of the game
the most inconvenient times ( sometimes killing my character )
Might have to reprogram the mouse myself just to not be sent
browsing the internet
I recommend you look into
you look into a different mouse
you move the mouse too fast
the movement does n't register
This Mouse will Not function well in FPS game
It 's heavy to move around
to move around in FPS game
I tried to tweak the buttons in the game
i started new session all the buttons
the buttons went back to their Useless unrelated
the Fire button acted as jumping button
jumping button instead of firing
I 'm sending back
getting something else .This Mouse will be perfect
The mouse worked first time
I read postings by others
tried everything
ensuring console and keyboard
unplugging and replugging in mouse
taking batteries out
rebooting
Nothing worked
Based on postings
frustrating for me
It 's now in the trash
I will never purchase another LeapFrog product
I knew I would be charged half the cost
I would have kept it till when
I decide to get a t .v in my daughter

her to understand at 4 years
I do not subscribe to give children too much access to
media device especially TV in a preschooler room
it comes with
the mouse does not work very well
you move it
to move around
this thing does not come with an ac adapter to plug
an ac adapter to plug it in
runs through the batteries like crazy
playing with it for just a little bit
just a little bit drains the batteries
to drop the extra money on the adapter
my family tends to shy away from toys
that require constant new batteries
My daughter liked it
I do not recommend
I wanted SOOO badly to like
SOOO badly to like this toy
We got the first one for Christmas
it worked for about a week until
stopped working
This computer will not work without a mouse

my son did n't undertand
He kept asking me to fix

This whole system relies on the mouse
no other way to use this without the mouse
The keyboard unit does not have an off switch
polls looking for the control unit
We turned it on for
it on for the first time
used for about 15 minutes
we came back to it
to use
to find in stores.It has great educational value
stores.It has great educational value for the youngster
the youngster just learning their letters and numbers
it worked properly
has an extremely limited range of levels so
a smart kid will outgrow it quickly
does n't function well
which gets extremely expensive if your kid
likes this thing
you cannot turn the keyboard/mouse off so the batteries
the batteries run down even when
You have to remove the batteries to prevent
the batteries to prevent this
My daughter enjoyed it
learned from it for about three months
needs to redesign this product
needs to come along
do it right
This has not been a good product for my 3/4 year
The games leave much
He prefers educational games that we
we can find online and this did not make him
online and this did not make him want to use
him want to use our laptop less
I thought it would do
it would do )
Frustrating to use
I do not recommend this product
Purchased for my son 's 4rth birthday

shapes / colors / numbers
the mouse started to malfunction the second time we used

You ca n't even log on without the mouse
any way to cause a malfunction like this
you have to take the batteries out
which requires a screw-driver ) to prevent them

refuse to build one
Worked for about 2 hours then the touch scroll
the touch scroll stopped working
it went nuts
would n't stop a couple times before that
Do n't buy
it 's
to use
your fingers do n't reach to the front you
you will have to push harder
to click
I will start out by saying
saying that I
I love this mouse
wish I could give
I could give this a 5 star review
a critical issue standing in the way .After
I noticed that I
the scroll area would stop functioning
the mouse movement would become very jagged
first I figured it was
the problem persisted
I went on to try resetting
to try resetting the USB sensor
even trying to update the mouse driver. I eventually gave
gave up hopes of this mouse
this mouse functioning properly
just dealt with the process of squishing
squishing the mouse down
bending it back to get another ten minutes or so
to get another ten minutes or so of normal use

clicks
rendering the mouse about useless
I purchased last year

it works maybe 2 % of
I wanted to click and drag a scroll bar I would use
I would use an old mouse
Was so hoping this would work as well as
this would work as well as my Mac touch mouse .Wasted money
Touch scroll works about 10 % of the time
I depend on the scroll
Do n't buy it
I 've ever tried to use
Hard to hold onto
I ca n't see how Microsoft put
Microsoft put their name on it
it will stop working at least 2 or 3 times a day
The scroll will also get stuck

works on black surface
does n't work functionally
The scroll moves like this mouse is
I have to go back use
use my almost dead logitech mouse
being mostly satisfied with my Microsoft Surface Pro I decided to try
I decided to try another piece of MS hardware
I thought it was novel
the mouse folds flat for travel
this mouse has
all lived up to the design
lags in response to movement
It 's feels like my computer
my computer has too many tasks going
too many tasks going on
that 's the purpose for the delay
I have no problems with any other apps or hardware
I can only conclude it 's the mouse
it 's the mouse itself
to use as
it 's
I 'd say this product is
I 'm sure will be
I have ever owned
They would let me give it
me give it NO stars
I would have

I have to switch it off
to make it

I ca n't see what 's wrong with
It does n't ever feel
stuck
wo n't work
I 've gone back to using

you need it
the ergonomics leave much

to find compared to the typical mouse wheel
I feel is
I do like the electronic tactile feel of
I 'm using Win8
I did n't throw out the box so
I could return
I bought it
use my computer- once a day in
having it for about 8 months
I put brand new batteries in it
they will not last more than 2 days in it.Also
it will not scroll
I have to take the batteries out
put them back in
it works again

moving the cursor
lagging all the time
Decided after the Bluetooth fiasco to get the version
the Bluetooth fiasco to get the version that has

You have to turn it off and on again

I got the Lenovo N700
This one seem very well built
feels a bit better in my hand
do n't have big hands
I 'm fine with both

Had to fiddle with the mouse preferences a bit until
I got something acceptable.Conclusion
MS failed to deliver on the Arc
both receiver and bluetooth based
Spent some budgets
changed quite a few
try Lenovo N700
I 'm happy
Forget the swipe thing if you

I 'm normally a huge fan of
this mouse leaves my hand feeling
my hand feeling sore
I 'm a daily user of their standard wired mouse
which has great palm support
has none
It feels like you 're moving
you 're moving around a credit card instead
you can comfortably rest your hand on
Apple can do better than this
Their latest and greatest mouse may win awards for industrial design
it 's not winning the comfort of my hand

it 's days are numbered
Do

which made it randomly click/select and delete some
it randomly click/select and delete some of my computer files
This might have been an OK item had it
an OK item had it not
arrived broken
I have the joy of returning
returning the item
They need to check the quality before it
it ships out
Bought 2 sets
Buy for the keyboard
toss the mouse
I bought this keyboard and mouse so that
my son could use my MacBook Pro for his video games
would n't have to touch the actual machine
we had a lot of problems
did not like the keyboard because it
it did not do a lot of the shortcuts
I use everyday for
cutting and pasting
I have ever sent back because I
did n't like it
I did like the feel of
you just use it for typing and simple data processing
sucked
received the mouse
got the keyboard
I would really like to get that
the mouse works great
I ordered this and was sent
chatting with Amazon customer service
I ordered it for a second time
a second time to get the keyboard
I got another mouse only
I do n't think it should be hard
to send them both together
The key board does not work with the mouse
I do not want to have to monkey with
trying to pair one
it works you pair the mouse
it works
it does not work
really even write a review about an item
I feel really compelled to say something about this mouse and keyboard combo
this mouse and keyboard combo set
I have had a few issues with it.Cons :1st
It will go in
This happens while the mouse is
I have tried 3 sets of batteries
The Keyboard has a similar issue of kind
using the keyboard
you cannot tell it that bad
the keyboard to control something that is
using it as a midi keyboard controller
you will defiantly see it
I tested the Mouse
The negative effects seemed to happen on each of
To give it the benefit of a doubt
I thought maybe I need to go
I need to go download the drivers from
Hah ! Good luck finding them on the site
I could locate my product
All I could find was a paragraph stating
a paragraph stating that “most ” of
their products did not need drivers
your operating system should have one built in
one built in for it
it works with the built in
The set did come with a disk
of had drivers on it
I will say that the keyboard feels
the keyboard feels really great while typing
typing a letter
the thing works great.Mouse
have nothing good to say about
to say about the mouse
I trashed it the 2nd day of
I did not test the keyboard with MAC or Linux
might later and update this thing. In Conclusion :If
I had it to do
it to do over again
I would not have purchased this item
a bad one and others might work better
seeing how
I don’t think I will buy any more
I will buy any more of their products
looked OK
did n't work well
Did n't communicate well with dongle
keyboard would not register input
I TYPE IT DOES NOT SHOW ANYTHING ON THE SCREEN AND THEN SEVERAL WORDS WILL PUP UP

I guess for the cheap price I
I got a cheap looking product
it does what it
it takes up less space on
This keyboard and mouse had all the features I was looking
to get any response
others got stuck every time they
I retuened the set for a refund
you know nothing about navigating
navigating windows
you ca n't put a mouse in it
do n't expect to actually carry your accessories in the pocket
I put my laptop in
could not zip the main compartment
it digs into my shoulder
it broke
I have a Mac Book Pro ( 15.6 inch
I used this bag occasionally for
The strap broke on one side
Seems good at first
the strap broke
my laptop fell
do n't quite understand why it broke
it broke so easily
I expected
Not enough space to pack the mouse and cords
all like shown in picture it
looked washed out
I picked this product for the vibrancy
the colors ..very dissapointed
This product broke a few weeks after I
I got it
it .
broke off
my laptop dropped to the ground
broke
it has a yellowish tint
This mouse worked fairly well for a bit
I mean
works
it 's
gave out after about two weeks of use
I have managed to live with
I just assigned that function to
work most of the time
do n't respond
ranging from similar levels of clickiness
that give almost no helpful feedback
do n't get me started on
me started on the drivers
you can look anywhere
find people making
people making similar claims
I had no idea how annoying it
it would get
It takes a minute to kick
I can see why that would be
there 's no way for me
me to store a profile onto the mouse
Does n't turn on
It does like
I have to unplug the thing
plug it back in before
it 'll register
Which does n't happen with any other mouse I
I 've ever used
which baffles me
goes off the wall whenever it
it wants
I 'll leave it at a set value
it will
The value appears the same in the CUE software
I assure you
it raises itself
that 's yet another instance where I
I have to unplug the thing.Yeah
I do n't know
I love the way it feels
it feels in my hand
do n't know if I can ever buy
I can ever buy a Corsair mouse again
I 'll stick with it for
I 'm gonna jump ship
I 've been with Razer
try out Logitech
I 'll give it a go
I used to use the razer naga for the longest time
played MMOs back then
I had about 3 nagas that each
each lasted a very long time for how much use
I got out of them
that feels good in the hand
this mouse falls flat
to hold
to press
feels way too big
I 've used the naga all this time
I tried using this mouse for 2 weeks
just could n't get myself to like
myself to like it
I should have heeded the many reviews about this product
Corsair Utility Engine fails 4/5 times I boot
boot my computer
the mouse does not work at all
I regret my purchase of this device
know I do n't have a hope of
I do n't have a hope of a return
it 's strong points
HEAVILY let down by the software
I have consulted the Corsair Support
reinstall all of my Corsair equipment to remedy
my Corsair equipment to remedy my issues
I 've already done that several times
encouraging me to simply reinstall the software
me to simply reinstall the software they
they propose
help to support their device
another Corsair manufactured item that needs
that needs a software to manage the hardware
a software to manage the hardware properly
Razer can do that properly even though
I do n't have the best of an opinion
I had a Razer Naga for a while
I decided it was time
My husband had been hearing good things about Corsair gaming mouses
I decided to give them a shot
I should have read the reviews here first myself
Corsair knows about it
has n't fixed it
I 'm a streamer and hardcore gamer
What happens is that
the mouse will just stop working
You have to restart your computer to basically reset the mouse
your computer to basically reset the mouse to get it
the mouse to get it to work
it to work again
This happened 3 times in a two day period
Do n't mess with my biz
my biz please
I packed this horrible thing up
sent it back
Turned around
bought a Razer

their software issues figured out I was
Get It Together Corsair !
I 've had better mice that I
I bought from the dollar store
ran over with an 18 wheeler 10 times
this mouse did out of the box.It
the box.It feels cheap
feels clunky
the side buttons feel like a fisher price knock off
you 're lucky will actually send the input
lucky will actually send the input through once
they 're asking for it should be
that can at least function
it 's overpriced
has unresponsive buttons
feels cheap
you ca n't turn it
it off
the program required for this mouse to
a labyrinth to navigate
It 's braided so terribly
it drags across the desk
get caught on everything
always tugs the mouse one way
you want to play
The mouse does n't glide across even the smoothest of
it feels like sandpaper is just trudging
the colors look the same
you want a dark purple
want red because that 's
that 's all this mouse will give
all this mouse will give you
It 's a joke that it
it has the full color wheel in the software
Claiming to have 12 million color changes is just a flat out
lie.TL;DR do not buy this mouse it is
I 've ever put my hands on
I 've picked up dog droppings with more responsiveness
this mouse has
dropped the ball on this one
relies on absolute garbage software
requires a repair about every 3 days for
least companies like Razer allow
Razer allow these buttons to act as
these buttons to act as number keys without
that have issues with the software
it does n't look like it has gotten
it has gotten any better over the past year
I 've ever used
I would rather use a mouse with a ball
that runs this stupid thing is by
I 've ever seen in my life
Do yourself a favor
stay far away from this
You 'll thank me later
I bought it thinking it
it thinking it would be great
to find it is incompatible with
has no technical support available during business hours
it came highly recommended
the mouse takes up sooooo much bandwidth
made me lag
me lag balls
I could n't use it
I 've had the Scimitar a week
coming from a G600.1
The side buttons do not always work
the PC returned the function
The corsair forums shows this issue has been around
this issue has been around for almost a year
it 's the main feature of this product.2
the mouse uses the profile the software installed
the software installed with
logging into your OS.
this seems to happen
( Made me miss on-board settings on my G600 and G500 even)3
Resting my thumb on the mouse-pad looks and feels
the mouse-pad looks and feels like it 's
it 's between key 1 and 2
seem to hit # 1 when pressing
# 1 when pressing .4
Sliding the side keys full forward is
a LED light to shine onto the side keypad
has back lights
you can adjust it
The side keys have a little texture on the 2nd and 4th column
you 're more likely to feel the light port
to feel the light port sticking out when
the light port sticking out when you
you move your thumb all the way
The software looks like could be
just trying to set up simple button presses to get going
simple button presses to get going is
The scroll wheel seems extra resistant to rolling
corsair has released is
This causes the number buttons on the side
the side to not work with a lot of
mapping the number keys on the side
the side does not work
Google search "scimitar number keys not working
you will see this
you purchase this mouse for
for does n't work
Corsair has yet to comment on this issue
does n't look like they plan
they plan on fixing
fixing it
I 'm incredibly disappointed with this product
I have very mixed feelings about this mouse
I love the way it
it looks
it 's a lot more usable to
moving the thumb pad is
it "feels
I would say medium gaming load )
the left click does n't function at 100 %
misses left clicks
to ensure that it registers now
it registers now I have to basically jam
I have to basically jam the clicker in pretty hard
I risk moments of frustration
I click things and nothing happens because
things and nothing happens because the mouse
the mouse did n't want to recognize it
It 's such a frustrating ailment that I
swapped to my cheapo replacement mouse until I
I can figure out what to replace
what to replace it
it 's first two months I did n't have
I did n't have a single complaint
I felt that the client for
changing colors and binds was a little bit too complicated to learn
a little bit too complicated to learn how to utilize
to utilize properly
you wanna bind
hitting the key you want bound to
you want bound to it
you have to go create specific actions of specific types
assign them individually to each button
I do n't know it just comes
comes off as a bit excessively tedious
I want to hope that this is
got really unlucky
it 's hard to re-convince customers
to re-convince customers after such a short stint of
working functionality that I 'm
I 'm the special snowflake who got
who got the bad model
to convince me in buying a 2nd one
buying a 2nd one of these after
I did like the aesthetic ,
it worked
I did enjoy using it
setting keys/binds/colors that
to navigate at first
the mouse ending in a defect that
makes this a low rating product for me
I did n't even have to plug it in to know
to know it would n't replace
it would n't replace my aging Logitech
get to the point
it feels terrible compared to
compared to the G600
The buttons feel mushy and unresponsive
they feel crowded and indistinct
ridges you immediately know where you
you immediately know where you are and what
my thumb dragging on the mouse pad when
The upper buttons feel okay
the middle mouse button does n't actuate evenly
instead tilting to the right when pressed
pressed instead of going
going straight down
you need the extra buttons look at
the extra buttons look at the Razer Naga Chroma
oh my goodness what an absolutely horrific sensor
my goodness what an absolutely horrific sensor they
they slammed on this mouse
it will still register like its making full contact
save yourself some time and money
buy a g502
you need the extra buttons
wait for logitech to make a similar one
logitech to make a similar one with a decent sensor.A good mouse
a decent sensor.A good mouse ruined by the worst sensor ive ever
held in my hands
it says on the mouse
This mouse has 2 side buttons
I could adjust mouse speed
worked appx 25 %
Does not work with windows 8.1 as
I tested this on a friends computer windows
it works on there
not 8.1.

That 's a dirty , underhanded sales tactic taking advantage of the consumer
Wacom should sell used cars instead of

I 'm entitled to use
it seems as the years increase
the years increase their products get
their products get more mediocre
a pleasure to draw on
It feels stiff , cheap
has a distinctly unpleasant sound as the pen goes
the pen goes across the pad

who has used alternative products over time
I can honestly say the Intuous Draw feels bad
the Intuous Draw feels bad even compared
compared to generic run of the mill tablets
Wacom stands for time tested
time tested digital art products
I purchased this product I felt
I felt my stomach drop the moment
my stomach drop the moment I used
I used it
lines would go from a 10 in
you work with lineart as

this causes serious issues
it makes all lineart really shoddy

I use all tablets once
to test the level of pen pressure and
the terrible line work the 'paper ' quality felt more

this product can rate over 4 stars
buying this product was to get the software downloads
the software downloads that was advertised as
coming with the tablet
you cannot download the software
The Wacom website freezes every time you try to register

others make the same mistake I
I did
I hope it includes

My daughter saved up her money
got this
loves it
has created some amazing art with it
The pen does get lost easily though
a place to keep the pen on the pad
you have to keep them together
update
this pad has started malfunctioning
you contact the company for help
they do not respond
They do send you an email saying
an email saying they received
they received your support request
I guess that is
Save your money for a better drawing pad
dealing with Wacom support for over 4 weeks
they will not accept it as a return
give some credit to the purchase of
replacing it for the same item
They want to blame everything else for
the tablet not working
dealing with the cable or phone company
Save your money
purchase something more dependable .**Update
ended up giving up with Wacom support
the user being blamed for the malfunctioning tablet
I took the hit
purchased a XP-Pen Star05 Wireless 2.4G Graphics Drawing Tablet
Dont buy a Wacom
instead pick up the Star05
XP-Pen has much much better service
installing drivers for usb/bluetooth/wireless devices is
The tablet arrived in great condition
I could n't wait to try it
searching forums for solutions , downloading and re-downloading drivers
I had to give up
the cursor jerks around uncontrollably
I have contacted customer support
would love to give this product a higher rating once
I do n't like how heavy the keys
the keys feels
display the presence of functioning
functioning CAPS Lock
I 've ever used
I ordered do
have operating lights
I ordered two and should have returned both
two and should have returned both if not at least one
I feared that the keyboard would n't last
the keyboard would n't last long so I just
bought two
should have saved my money
I missed my window of opportunity
opportunity to return these so I
I feel I should contribute to
I should contribute to the consumer reviews
did not come with instructions
Do yourself the favor
spend the money on a more durable product
I own this product just over 3 months
it has already broken
have to purchase a new one
which makes the cost savings null & void
This seller does not return messages to inquiries
Choose to do business with another vendor
The keyboard does n't response well even with
I have to retype many many times to get to
many many times to get to what I
I want
Purchased this combo for the extra FORWARD/BACK buttons on
Was tired of constantly find my CAPS
constantly find my CAPS on
off without a warning light to help.You
help.You see the NUM LOCK light on in
That 's what you get
you get when you put
you put the batteries in the keyboard
you plug in the USB receiver
no lights to tell you if
I 'm guessing
brush over them with some white out
several keys hang
it 's almost impossible
to use
i 'm planning to return them
Had to send it back
EXTREMELY STRONG ODER like toxic VOC's
I would imagine using this for an extended period
pressing certain keys would react as if
certain keys would react as if you
you had pressed multiple buttons
The CTRL key did n't work at all
felt extremely cheap
Spend an extra few dollars
buy a product from a company you
you 've heard of.The mouse worked
of.The mouse worked fine
Getting what you pay for
you pay for with this one
has some real issues
produces terrible accuracy
the shift buttons feel different from the other keys
Would look for a different model
they do work
these and and month later they all but 2 are in
the keys not working
The mouse worked fine
the keyboard did not
I should hae lisened o

continuously has connection issues causing the keyboard and mouse
connection issues causing the keyboard and mouse to not respond
the keyboard and mouse to not respond correctly
I purchased 5 of these

It does n't pay to go cheap on items
Do n't waste you money
Go buy a product that actually works
works like it
it 's supposed too
I could give this zero stars
I would
I guess I got what
I got what I paid
I paid for
returning it
could have dealt with the cheap factor
my keyboard crapped out
bought this on Amazon
had it delivered
it delivered the same day
I could n't even type with it because
I have to wiggle the battery several times to get
the battery several times to get the keyboard and mouse
the keyboard and mouse to work
they worked
it worked fine for a few days
repeated the same issue over again
The keyboard does n't work properly most of the time
It works when it wants to and
it wants to and it gets irritating
it gets irritating after a while
I would n't buy again
I should have bought a logitech
to carry tho
worked intermittently
Returned it
impressed but will use it until I
I get over frustrated
The keyboard works great
Pointer flutters all over the screen
it has a mind of its own
Had to get a new mouse
Pay a little more
get one that works rather
that works rather than what
I did trying to save a buck that ended up costing
that ended up costing more in the long run
the keyboard sucks big tash
I noticed that some of
I have since then purchased
purchased a 12.00 logitech keyboard from Walmart

Some keys function as other keys ( ex
functions as the delete button

had to use tape to keep the battery cover attached
tape to keep the battery cover attached to
the battery cover attached to the keyboard
def would not buy again
to use
you have to press extremely hard on each key
misses keystrokes
The mouse auto turns off after
I ordered this keyboard because it
it has a caps lock light
slowed my tying speed
caused more errors due to missed keystrokes
I do not recommend this product
the mouse stopped responding as I
it would recognize the I clicked on
the I clicked on something after
I rate this as a flop
spend the extra dollar
buy a better brand
the keyboard letters stick
ca n't type much at all
Keys had good touch
Mouse would turn off from time to
I thought there was a bad connection
I had to download a third program driver
I returned it for a refund
to press
you need strong fingers
DO NOT BUY
it came without batteries
the battery cover pops up . the keys are
Do n't buy

I know this is
I 'd rate it much higher
it could have lasted a year
came without a cover for the battery comprtment

I do wish the keyboard had
the keyboard had an on/off switch
the mouse does have one .Update 2/17/1017
being in use for a few hours
the keyboard began failing to type
would double type
This occurred after using it
using it for 10 months
rebooting the computer would cause it
the computer would cause it to operated
it to operated correctly again
the wheel has ceased working properly
Works ok as a keyboard
they redesigned the return button
moved the shift button
messes up your typing
the wireless dongle does n't have any strength
It stops connectivity thru the one inch
I would not purchase again
I will say I have n't had any issues
I have n't had any issues with the mouse
The mouse worked inconsistently
using the mouse for only 20 min
I gave up
repackaged it

I went and purchased a higher quality mouse and keyboard ...of couse
it cost me 3 times more
They take a beating and on
the mouse did not hold up
the keyboard had a cheap feel with impractical lighting effects
DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I
I DID
I bought a BLACK mousepad
got a blue one with TERRIBLE quality
the item does n't even come close to what
I got
washed out
other reviewers have mentioned
has gel inside
it has some sort of
It does not have a pleasant smell and something inside cheaply crinkles
you depress the wrist cushion
The pad started out great
the wrist pad part apparently deflated after a month or so of
the pad provides no wrist support
I 'm having to use a small wrist beanbag instead
I would n't buy this product again. I
this product again. I purchased this product
I purchased this product because of all the 5-star reviews
It 's possible that the mouse pad
I got is
it 's unusable for the purpose
I bought it
The mouse does n't work on it
it works on the desk
I had the same pad before which
which had the same problem
The mouse stopped working on it
I think the problem is
I will never buy this again
I wanted to use it so bad
now its all squeezed and do not support like i
all squeezed and do not support like i did
i did 3 weeks ago
wont recommend getting this product
Got mine today
found the wrist pad only half as high as
It works ok
Stopped using it
went back to a flat black pad
mouse to see or something
That wrist part did n't feel like it full
It feels half full and when you
you move your wrist around it
made a sound that reminds me
that reminds me of plastic wrapper
plastic wrapper slowly being undone after you scrunch
you scrunch it into a ball
Will need to buy a different one for my dad
disappointed with this mouse pad
purchased both a gel keyboard and wrist pads from a Best Buy store
I know one of them
did n't move around when I moved
I moved my wrist/arm/hand
They lasted years ( despite my young nieces
my young nieces poking a hole in the mouse pad
the mouse pad to play with the gel )
received is
does not contain gel
I squeeze it
even rest my wrist on it
it pops like it has
it has bubble wrapping in it
have heeded previous reviews that theirs
theirs had "foam
I thought surely if I
I buy one that " ships from
sold by Amazon.com
I would receive a good one
It does not lay flat on my desk
the ends raise up depending on the movement of
causing friction as I move
I move my wrist around
a physical store to buy a better quality replacement
mouse does n't run smoothly over
you know how I
I know
YOU REST YOUR WRISTS ON IT.
that supports your wrist is much thicker
imagined
it raises my hand so much that
I can no longer rest my palm on my mouse
have to move with it just my fingertips
which ruins the ergonomic properties of the mouse
It 's incredibly distracting
cramps my hand when using
my hand when using it
defeating the purpose of this whole thing
using a mouse with just your fingertips
I would find a different product
I should 've read the reviews first
that 's stiffer
hurts more from using this product
using this product because my mouse is
the wrist support raises my wrist/palm in a way
have two choices
The former gives me cramped
me cramped hands
the latter hurts my wrist more
makes some sort of weird crunching sound
Belkin used to make quality products
will inform others as well
getting tired
I have an old Belkin mousepad just like
one lasted me for over 10 years
I 'm
this feels really cheap
The nylon has snagged in multiple places after
The gel pad has lost its support
it 's almost as though it
it deflated into the shape of
held its shape
wore out
my wrist wants to lie
will not go away
I had to get my old mouse pad out
pile it on top of
this one .Will not buy again
They changed the inside from gel pad
It provides no wrist support at all
These used to be
newspaper scrunched up
gel
I made the foolish mistake of
reading the comments before buying
I assumed Belkin
being a reputable brand
would never cheap out on their products
I took delivery of this mouse pad
I found out I
does not give way to your wrist as
a normal gel pad would
does have a horrid scent to it
I 've decided to continue the usage of my 13 year old mouse pad
I read the reviews
ultimately decided on a mousepad at the last minute

I tried real hard in
I ended up returning the product
I 'm not going to wait for support
I 'm starting to look at the Razer Orochi
I 'll have a better experience there
I purchased this product over a month
receiving the mouse
I continued to install the drivers and software
found that the device was defective ( intermittent communication
I received no help other than
I had already gone through.After a phone call
to obtain an RMA for my device .They
.They promised a return shipping label
I had to request a second time ...Finally
received my replacement! The replacement was obviously used .Scotch tape
I think
they must recycle their packaging ...nope! The product inside
dirty! The feet showed wear
a HAIR ( the kind of hair
to mention
the replacement does not function at all
stay away from any Mad Catz products !As
I write this review
all I can think of is how
I 've never spent this much on a peripheral , nor
a peripheral , nor have I EVER had
had this kind of trouble with
I 'm using it about 3 months
keep disconnecting using there Bluetooth adapter
buy Razer Orochi way better
I have windows 7 )
came the next issue
lights light up
no light coming from the laser sensor
Tried to contact Madcatz support by putting
putting in a ticket on the their wedsite
5 days have not received any message back
couldnt do anything for me anyway
This mouse lives up to its mobile name as
even the pictures seem on Amazon )
you can find a nice fit for medium
who use a fingertip grip such as myself
it to help you grip and spin
( really the best part of the whole mouse for
I could tell
to click in
too much resistance to press the button in the other directions
the other directions making very difficult to click it
to click it in the four directions without
moving the sensor which is obviously a nightmare
using awkward kind of grip that
that can create some kind of counter pressure
counter pressure to keep the mouse still as
feel like some plastic teeth
some plastic teeth do this
its easy to adjust
to adjust
can retract back in during gameplay
This mouse looks attractive as a
a shrunken down high quality gaming mouse
you might get one with a defective laser sensor
your computer cant recognized ( not a problem with
it does support bluetooth
to press some buttons without the mouse moving
the mouse moving about
using some awkward hand position
madcatz support might not even try to help you
to say the least I dont reccomend
I dont reccomend this mouse
I returned it
will try another mouse instead
It looks just like a updated version
I 've received it
understood that RAT M the M is
It 's way too small for
I bought this mouse for the Bluetooth capability
my tablets or computers can see it
You can set the setting on the DPI high enough
you do n't even need to move it more than
the battery lasting a year
you put it on its lowest settings
use it for an hour a day
run through my batteries in three weeks
I will use one of their commands
I do
it has n't caused any real harm
you should have to deal with
the MOUS 9 can manage to link to the magnify application
they deemed this model unfit to have
to have such a simple utility in a wireless mouse
this I could forgive
I tried to contact them three times
I got a response back once asking
asking for a little additional information
I have heard nothing more from
looking at other reviews
Considering the price
I expected more
I returned
thought it might have been
it might have been my laptop
I have a ROG G75
Got the second one
Called mad catz customer service
Save yourself the trouble and skip this one
I bought the Mad Catz R.A.T. M mouse in matte black
running Windows 7. Much of what I
I 'm going to write has been covered in
has been covered in a previous review
I will try to provide additional details .The short
the manufacturer left something out for
the device to work with Windows running
Windows running from a Boot Camp partition on
The mouse would only work with Windows if
moved
to get it recognized by
it recognized by my MBP
Neither operating system could even find the device no matter how
no matter how many times it was
put into pairing mode
I spoke with their technical support for
I wanted to restart my system
returning it
would probably buy it again IF the manufacturer
the manufacturer fixes their problems .Physically speaking
speaking the mouse looks and feels
the mouse looks and feels fantastic
liked using it
It 's about the size of
the back makes the mouse feel much larger
the mouse feel much larger in your hand
The mouse looks and feels very precise
that went into it
It feels expensive
examining the mouse
that comes with it is
It 's just a mesh sack
do n't play with the usb dongle .If I
I rebooted on the Mac side the usb dongle
the usb dongle worked plug and play
The mouse appeared to work well
I ca n't comment on the customization software since
I did n't try using that with OSX
The mouse seemed to work well ( plug and play ) on other Windows
laptops
I spent most of a day
a day trying to work out the issues stemming
the issues stemming from the usb dongle
This included what I was
to do on my own
speaking with Madcatz tech support until they
conceded defeat
getting a computer expert friend to look at
a computer expert friend to look at it
I suppose there may be some truth
that based on how it
it 's still a gross oversight in
their product. When plugging the usb dongle into the computer
the computer already running Windows an error message would pop up stating
an error message would pop up stating that an unknown USB device had been plugged
an unknown USB device had been plugged in
Clicking on the pop up brought
brought up an explanation that one
my usb devices had malfunctioned
it does it again
Windows would also state that there were
no driver files installed for the device
to correctly install the driver files again regardless of the method
there wound up being 3
we tried to circumvent this )
I went through the trouble of
physically tracking down the driver files that were installed
to make sure they were there
We tried updating the driver files
which windows returned that it was
displaying that there
We tried telling windows where the driver files
received an error message from that as well
I would recommend this for a windows
I question whether their bluetooth works at
the buttons felt a little on the awkward side
pushing up on the 5D button
using the "wing " button
I think a user may adapt with
a user may adapt with time
I got the mouse
returned it the next day
I may have received a faulty mouse
I expected from a premium price mouse
I tried installing it on my desktop PC
windows bootcamp 7 64 bit.ConstructionThe mouse
mouse felt good
Looked nice
I 'm used to a Logitech G5
Scroll wheel felt nice
to press
The usb dongle felt cheap though
The mouse may need time to get used to
time to get used to the button placement
I could establish
The desktop recognized it
it worked
I installed the software and drivers from the Madcatz website
to configure the mouse to my liking
so many different options to configure all of the buttons
I didnt have time to play around
time to play around with them
The mac recognized it too. Windows bootcamp

R.A.T MI have been using Logitech G700 for
I kept using it
I started playing COD
decided to buy a mouse that I can move
I can move with my wrist only
I can perform better.RAT M is

to move
you would like it to be .Bad :3D button
small and to close edges so I
I do n't feel comfortable using
comfortable using it
do n't think I will be able to use
to use it in situations where
I need fast respond
throwing grande in COD
you extend it
it goes over the mouse length
you make a pressure on the extension part
the mouse lifts up stopping the pointer movement
I click by accident
who use
its hard to grab the mouse
move it in air
Software gives you some configuration
you would say its built by 10 year old
it works
it forgets your configuration.Good :DP I cycle button
looks kind of funny since
general looks cool
lasting for a year vs G700
I had to change every week/two weeks ( or recharge )
I dont have many good things to say yet
many good things to say yet since I
did n't adapt to the mouse .After first 5 minutes
using it
I hated it
that 's normal
I have it for two days
I feel much better about it
still adjusting
all the bad sides could go away with getting
getting use to it
I think I will love this mouse
I will love this mouse very much
hate it
I will see it in a week
let you know.4 stars because
you know.4 stars because its a good concept
I need
I will get back in a week

I decided this is way
I went back to G700 )

I could have done something else with that minute

It implies that the drivers

I change the settings
The three click zones do n't work

write product reviews
had to leave a review for this mouse
I had such high hopes for this
My last Logitech mouse lasted me throughout my entire undergraduate and graduate career
I made the switch to Windows 8
it lost compatibility unfortunately
I found this mouse
tried it
it out
it 's sturdy
It works with Windows 8
has a ton of multi-functional touch activities
that 's what you 're looking
you 're looking for.CONS1-999
It 's literally just a dual button
years mice have had a literal "wheel
all got used to
Logitech has ripped that out from under
we need to get with the times
low-profile makes it even
worse
I experimented with the mouse using
the mouse using Microsoft Office
20min my right hand felt like
my right hand felt like it
it had already developed carpal tunnel
to sense a light touch
you 're literally having to drag your middle finger up and down on
ends with you landing on
you landing on the spot you
you meant to scroll to anyway
I ca n't imagine using this during a normal 8-9hr work day
This mouse merits its own circle of hell
no place to set your fingers on this mouse
this mouse to make it feel comfortable
it feel comfortable in your hands
I have pretty small hands
ca n't imagine someone with large hands using
large hands using this mouse
It sits very low
you do n't have an actual scroll wheel
there 's nowhere for you
you to set your middle finger
you set it on the touch-scroll
it thinks you
you 're trying to scroll
you end up with your middle finger
your middle finger hovering above the scroll button until
need to scroll.CONCLUSIONUnless you just HAVE to have the newest technology
HAVE to have the newest technology because it
it 's trendy
go for a mouse with an actual scroll wheel
I returned this item
instead got the " Microsoft Sculpt Mobile Mouse
Windows 8 ( has the same metro mode button on it
it )
to find that Logitech does not offer a smaller mouse with
that Logitech does not offer a smaller mouse with an actual scroll wheel
do n't bother looking

to click
I have used many wireless and wired mouses before
never got such kind of pain.Apart from
this the mouse performs very good on Windows 8 and 7
reading soo many reviews and researching too much i am highly disappointed with
You get what you pay
you pay for
I 've ever seen
It 's hard
to use
to hold
's 8 features left me completely unimpressed
this product gets the high rating is a mystery
I got this mouse is the scroll wheel
my old mouse keep getting clogged with cat hair
The touch sensor solves that
I keep accidentally back swiping in browser windows
the mouse makes it slide forward
it slide forward in my hand
I end up not being able
to click
I would not buy this again
Mouse looks very good
not work well in games
You cannot control whell scroll
it smooth only in some applications
which support by the mouse software
You can change it
you have to install special software which is crashe
requires restart in Win7 x64

I use it without the reciever
Anyone can give me a feedback
I have been buying logitech products for a long time
I 've ever owned
Do yourself a favor

I found it to be too small
to use for an extended time

Forget using this for any type of

This mouse lost its "left click
I 've down-graded the rating a point
I 've been using Logitech mice for 20 years
I wo n't use anything else .Pros :* Designed for
anything else .Pros :* Designed for Windows
You would want to install SetPoint for it
They brag that the batteries
the batteries will last a very long time
I could n't say exactly how long
I 've had this mouse awhile
SetPoint still reports the batteries as
reports the batteries as "full
Center "button " works as a touch-pad
You can swipe side-to-side
scrolling horizontally
This does n't always seem to work
expected
you swipe your fingertip vertically
you move your finger swiftly
There 's no center scroll wheel

all I will use from now on
it does n't slide quite as smoothly as the M515
I sit on my couch

I rated it 3 stars
It would have been 4 stars

I 've used the mouse for a month
decided to purchase a different mouse.The design is a little uncomfortable
you 've used it enough to get used
to get used to it
you get used to it .But
replacing the mouse is
the ability to double tap the bottom of
the touch zone to zoom
viewing a website in your browser
scrolling a web page ( swiping your finger up/down

The scroll feature leaves a lot

the mouse decides
I 'll stay with the wheel until
they get the technology for a touch mouse

It makes the clicking noise

palatableNO STARS ARE LOW ENOUGH TO RATE THIS PRODUCT
Did not meet expectations the whole keyboard lettering is way
it 's
would not buy
threw it away

battery would pop out easily to the point

Product looks appealing with style
reflects the price
It kept losing the connection with the internet
It works

I dont even
the keyboard looks good

time to test it

Will update
that made it two stars
I mean. . Broken
key board looks cheat
does n't come with instructions
mouse its fine
The mouse works well
it works
the mouse has a bit of lag
you hold a key down more than 2
it stops working
keep looking
Falls off way too easily
Adhesive stickers do not work
The clip works great
you 'll need some heavy duty adhesive to make
some heavy duty adhesive to make it
it work
They keep slipping out of the groove
Purchased these to organize some cables on
these to organize some cables on my night stand
they do the job of holding
holding the cables
they use has failed in
has failed in less than 2 weeks
I suppose you could put a screw
you could put a screw thru the center
use your own adhesive
double sided tape
that seems like a lot of
extra effort to fix an issue that
rethink your choice of adhesive on
it does n't hold up
These come un-stuck from all surfaces
will not hold
that holds it on
I have used have failed to hold the clip to
have failed to hold the clip to the tape
The tape stuck to the table fine
itself falls off after about
That 's unfortunate
These do not work well at all
The stickum lasted only a day
them fell down
tangling the cables
comes unstuck if there is a simple accidental yanking
wires come off to
They 're okay
I stuck one of these
The clip detached from the adhesive within
fell to the ground
to hold the most basic iphone charging wire in place
two cables do not hold the cables very well
them have started to unstick from the surfaces they
liked these
I would avoid this brand
They do n't stick well at all
they do not stick
They do what they
hold a cable )
they started falling
stored in a climate controlled environment for a while
I attempted to use this in my car
my car ( a comfortably heated one )
it would n't adhere to the console
it turned out
had been rendered utterly useless
I turned to less good-looking cable management clips that
they worked like a charm
Taught me to make sure I
me to make sure I test
I test a product even if
purchased for future use so that it
These do n't stay on for very long
Do n't stick very well
Comes off after a couple weeks
the desk top to run cables
come fall off
the adhesive wo n't stick
I would return if
I could
Stick with hook and loop
It works much better
The product looks very nice
The wire slips right in put
it slips right back out just as
to bother with the process of returning
falls off
They do not work
hold the damn wires
Just falls out immediately
Do not buy these
I have a hardwood floor
I needed to hold and route a cable wire
They stuck to the floor at
looked nice
I had to remive the stick pad from the floor
throw all of them out and order
them out and order something else
I do n't recommend rhem for serious jobs
does n't stick to anything for a long period
I have one on my bedside stand
my bedside stand to organize the cords to my lamp and phone
I have to restick it because it
it fell off
The sticky stuff would only last a week then all my cables
all my cables would end up on the floor
the sticky pads started failing after a week mounted
a week mounted under a desk
tried to replace the tape with some 3M and had
some 3M and had difficulty getting the tape
difficulty getting the tape to hold onto
the tape to hold onto the rubber
depending on the size of your cord
you may have difficulty with it
it staying on the holder
They 're a little big
I found the openings to slip the cables
the openings to slip the cables into were
they work pretty well
I 'll probably look around for something
have a bunch of these
I had high hopes for these clips
I purchased them to hold
them to hold CAT 6 cable
it did n't hold any of them
the clips would n't stick to the table
the seller made the return very quick & simple
They do the job as long as
you 're trying to mount them under something
they will probably fall off in a matter
I solved this by just
peeling off their sticky backing
using double-sided 3M tape
They do n't stick to anything upside-down
will fall off
other brands worked better
hold to smooth hard plastic when mounted
mounted mostly vertical
Comes off in less than a day
keep a coiled cord in place
tried this with different double-sided tape which
which held it in place
will not buy again
I loved the original for my sega
my 8 year old self remembers differently
they botched the controls pretty badly
I enjoyed seeing the levels reimagined with
the levels reimagined with more modern graphics
the character does not feel right at all
to control
they made a simple patch with some smoother character control
I had to quit playing out of frustration
I know my video card
these steam people doing
I could n't even play it because it
did n't work
It seems like a good game
not reccomended
it did n't work properly
you tell the character to perform
the character to perform an action
do it was
the game worked properly for me
I 'm sure it would be
I 'm just judging by my particular copy of
The controls do not respond well at all
It 's almost like slow motion
this game should go back into the drawing boards
do it right
that reflects poorly on the game
to tweak the registry to make the controls a bit
the registry to make the controls a bit better
to look at if the controls worked
the controls worked like they
they should have
it 's plagued with technical issues
running it at low settings (
low settings ( even with a much more powerful computer
it requires )
switch does n't work
made
the cursor freezes in one position
I cannot move it
I have to wait a while
try again
I did not have this problem with my wired mouse
I expected based on all the reviews
It 's cheap
I guess I got what
I got what I paid
I paid for
It does n't really work that well outside
did I see that this mouse has built
this mouse has built in acceleration
I 'd return it for a refund
I 'd end up only getting about a dollar back
took a risk on this product
lost
STOPS working at times
The cursor disappears from my screen
Turning the unit off n on
No USB came with this mouse
my thumb ( normal sized male hands
would straddle two buttons and press as I tired to move
I tired to move the mouse which also

it will slip from fingers
you grab hard enough to lift and end up

my hand kept slipping up the mouse
I had work

I returned it
went back to a conventional mouse
Has a strong cancer like smell that
could not bear anymore after having the product
having the product for five minutes
I placed it back in
requested a return
I would suggest moving to a different product such as
leather to avoid the rough surface and smell
that covers these wrist rests
these wrist rests is
making the inside of my wrists red and uncomfortable
to figure it out how

# SantaFail Might have to stop reconsider buying this brand
I decided to let my daughters Christmas ride on the reviews and slick marketing machine
A turnkey device designed for nothing but illustration
recommend that you ( the consumer )
you ( the consumer ) do not make the same mistake
the consumer ) do not make the same mistake I did
I did ( non-existent tech support
when trying to register )
There 's a reason that bigger brands
bigger brands dominate markets
boutique ones fade away
Some match their brand promise
lesson learned

her to use with a Chromebook
realizing it would be impossible not only
to use the tablet and pen
they include

it has been 2 days
I STILL cannot access the WACOM shop to register
the WACOM shop to register the device
get the comic software that I paid
I paid for
it does work great on

you burn through USB cables like
us do
love Wacom Tablets
have used them for years
ca n't live without them
something happens to the cable
I purchased the tablet
used if for 8 months
USB Micro-A cables worked
to make something work
I called Wacom
they said they would replace the cable

they have removed the eraser from the top
I like to use when I took
I took notes with Onenote .Another difference
an effort to shrink the size of the tablet
maintaining the same active area
Wacom have decided to remove all the palm rest area from the tablet
this may make the tablet look minimalistic
I can still use the edge of the tablet
the tablet to rest my hand on making
making it a comfortable writing experience
I write on the edge the tablet
I hit a cliff
no place to comfortably rest your hands on if
This made it extremely easy to access
to access all my shortcuts with my non-writing hand
two buttons placed on either side the tablet
you end up with two useless express keys because
you will never use the express keys on the side
you’re considering doing serious work on this tablet
I will suggest you to skip
you to skip this tablet
buy a used professional line Wacom tablet
A used Wacom tablet will still work with Windows 10
have much better resolution

I’ve been a Wacom user since
I’ve seen their products go up and down
their products go up and down in quality
I make my living doing
my living doing design work
using a tablet 8-10 hrs a day
I 've used in the past have felt
the past have felt like serious working tools
this thing feels like a toy for
making unicorn doodles.My number one beef with the Intuos
this device might have going for it is ruined
to hold comfortable
it might work if you
you have squirrel hands
It feels like you’re holding
you’re holding a McDonalds drinking straw with a point.3
you can’t easily locate them
Previous pens had more of a profile
to register the buttons in your hand without

the pen has a very
it ’s only hard plastic it
it provides no grip at all
The pen wants to slide from your fingers as
you work
Previous pen versions had a grippy rubber material at the end
that worked far better
see photo)5
looks and feels like a 10-cent toy you’d get
you’d get at the bottom of
that sums up the crummy pen
that 's got it 's problems
it 's problems as well
I find that I am constantly triggering
I’ve used it more I’ll figure out
to position my hand to prevent this but so far
my hand to prevent this but so far its making e crazy
four programmable buttons placed 2 at either side
which does n’t make them particularly useful as
you have to reach across the tablet to even use
the tablet to even use half the buttons
you have uses for these buttons
jamming the pen into this little loop requires
this little loop requires the strength of Popeye
it ’s even harder

played with a little novelty called

the one thing Wacom nailed on this device
it stores well
to tame with wire management gizmos so it
it allows for a tidy desk

WACOM has slipped yet again into one
they try
they can produce good stuff
you do buy this cheap-o toy ,hang on to

want to send it back once you
you experience all it shortcomings
It 's a great tablet once you

I cried about 6 times while
setting it
it up
it 's certainly
have my doubts about it being

lost her pen
likes this product
would probably give it 5 stars
I hate it since the pen
the pen sold separately is about the same price
I bought this item for my daughter
she loved it
It worked great
order to even use it she has to hold
she has to hold her stylus at such an odd angle
it 's impossible for
her to draw
It zooms in picture in
It leaves pen marks where she
she did n't draw anything
I would say it was user error
she had n't been using it fine for

Wacom stopped supporting that model in driver updates

discovered that the pressure sensitivity would cut

making it less reactionary as a mechanical mouse
playing competitively

Good luck getting the battery out

it 's frustrating when I
I ca n't even replace the battery without smashing
smashing it into the floor
just does n't respond
Which makes it effectively useless as
I have to " shake it
it off
to get it to respond to movements
it to respond to movements again
does n't matter
it does n't provide the most basic functionality of a mouse
when scrolling down
it scrolls the page up more often.Edit

This mouse requires intricate thumb function to use

my mother will have a very difficult time using
a very difficult time using the thumb
I had to return it because she
to use the thumb buttons at all
I think it would work
it would work better
I 've got tendinitis in my right elbow and wrist
I purchased this hoping to alleviate the pain
this hoping to alleviate the pain I have
I have while
mousing right
handed
this product did not provide that comfort or pain relief for me
It might work for carpal-tunnel symptoms
it did not help me at all
relieving tendinitis pain
hate this design as it
it 's really awkward
I guess you can get used to
you can get used to it
you get used to it
it will start making your thumb hurt after
your thumb hurt after extensive use
you have severe issues with regular or ergo mice
to use I
I guess
I expected
I have large hands
the pictures have hands half my size .Large
hands half my size .Large is Medium
it does
you scroll
No way to do that
No way to configure it
going into the mouse settings.Then after
the mouse stopped working unless I
I unplugged it
plugged it back in.Returned
makes it inaccurate to select on
to select on the screen
to use
I ordered a vertical mouse
to relieve the pain in my wrist
This one did n't do anything for me
I found the absence of a scroll button
which makes scrolling
scrolling very easy
ran into various compatibility issues
I had trouble reprogramming
trouble reprogramming the buttons
I 've returned it
I used it constantly for
I expected it would take some getting
it would take some getting used to
some getting used to as most people are n't used
the subtle motions involved with this grip compared
this grip compared to a normal mouse
I would not recommend this product for anyone
who does complex things like surf
work a spreadsheet
they decided that the large finger button on
requires you to move
you to move the entire mouse
the entire mouse to scroll
you hit it quickly
it goes to any hyperlink you
you might have the cursor resting
the cursor resting near
I 'm sure there are
I can mess with
I do n't have the time or inclination to waste
the time or inclination to waste my time
my time "discovering
to set the mouse up
It did n't have a scroll wheel
that alone made it not worth it
I returned it
I 'll give it two for
to control it you have to move
you have to move the entire arm
it 's clumsy and difficult to be precise
it did absolutely nothing for my RSI.
It looks like others have had
others have had success with it
I bought the wired 3M
the wired 3M ergo mouse
it does not seem to work on
called 3M phone support
all he could tell me
I know it 's
it 's crazy
we have no support for this product
to use this mouse with precision
My sore wrist did not hurt anymore using this mouse
it broke in a few days
I sent it back
have been unable to get
to get a new one
I loved the feel of this mouse
helped my carpal tunnel
the left click button started sticking after only a few weeks of
I ordered a replacement
experienced the same problem
I would have given this mouse 5 stars for
the sticking button made it just too annoying
to use
I have purchased that has been a serious disappointment
that has been a serious disappointment in quality
I knew that going into
going into it based on
it based on previous reviews
Everything said previously is correct about
some the thumb button has begun to stick
I have only been using it for a few hours
I hope that 3M actually
reviews what people say about
people say about their products
I would ever want to buy anything from 3M
I bought this mouse since I
I started getting some pain in my
my write from extended mouse use
I wanted to buy something ergonomic
I found positioning the cursor accurately quite difficult
The mouse would also fall off often from
I returned this and bought a Logitech
this and bought a Logitech Trackman
I find the trackman much easier and comfortable
I get pains in my hands and knuckles
using a standard mouse
alleviating those pains
you have a PC
purchased this item to relieve some tension in
this item to relieve some tension in my fingers
I get when using the mouse
using the mouse a lot
I read about this mouse
I ordered them
I like that I can rest
I can rest my whole hand on it
It took about a week to get
about a week to get use
use to
I could tell I had a lot less stress
I had a lot less stress in my hand and shoulder

this 3M mouse does n't have
I did n't like the 3M mouse
it bothered my hand to have the right side rest
my hand to have the right side rest on the base
could n't give up the scroll wheel
I would recommend you to consider
you to consider the Handshoe mouse
your hand fits into is
does make a difference
it ranks highly
I have Friedrich 's Ataxia
a progressive nerve disorder affecting my balance
I tried this mouse hoping that
this mouse hoping that it
to use and control
I did not have good control with it
I thought that just the joystick
just the joystick would move
the base would not
you had to move the whole mouse
I would have to stabilize the base just so
I could get a good grip on the joystick part
went back to it
I have seen for special joystick type mouses
I can still manage with the regular mouse for
Just have to take breaks every now and again
my hand does not cramp up really bad
my hand-eye coordination gets a rest from the struggles
controlling the mouse
I put it in the car
it get it
it damaged
programed obsolescence
dissapointed me.The laser now it
to use
you can work with on a regular mouse
a task takes 1 second on a regular mouse
it will take 4-5 seconds on this mouse )
you will abandon it after a few minutes
I purchased this product thinking the joy stick
this product thinking the joy stick has
the joy stick has a joint
you keep the mouse in one
push the stick in different direction
move it ( like
it ( like those helicopter commands
those helicopter commands )
you have to move the entire actual thing around
a light mouse to move .Third
moving around
YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT
to move the mouse pointer across the screener
You will have to get an Extra-Large mouse pad because will not fit
will not fit on a regular mouse pad
to move the pointer across the screen .Fourth
it feels really awkward and unnatural to use
to use .Fifth
3M does not even offer a specific driver for this mouse
It does not come with a CD
Google searches did not yield a legitimate driver software so 3M
3M has not released one.CONCLUSION
It takes 4-5 longer to use than
4-5 longer to use than a regular mouse
a regular mouse to use
you get
do n't recommend it at all
I 'm on the computer 10-12 hours
this device would help with my over-use issues in
I did experience some relief initially
the over-use issues had moved from my wrist to
I use the mouse alot
have been having increasing pain in my right hand
I purchased this mouse hoping it
this mouse hoping it would ease
it would ease all the pain
I used this about 30 minutes
it has n't helped the pain at all
does n't get this fatigued until 3-4 hours
using it 30 minutes has put me
30 minutes has put me in great pain and hand fatigue
I believe
you have to move your whole hand
which means that even if
your hand did n't hurt
your shoulder and upper arm will get sore from using
using it alot
you will probably build muscles
you will burn more calories just sitting at
more calories just sitting at your desk
ease the hand pain
Return it right away
using this mouse
I had a lot of pain
eliminated the pain that I had
I had in my wrist and index finger
I developed new pain in different parts
I switched back to a conventional mouse
I switched back and forth with this mouse
stopped switching when this mouse suddenly
stopped working
I use a conventional mouse
do hand and wrist exercises
I found a great video
ca n't remember where I found it
I found it )daily
The exercises have helped more than anything
do n't buy this
I found the position they thought
they thought was neutral for
stands
the air would have been more comfortable
this stands forward
it 's very difficult to use the mouse
to use the mouse without hitting
hitting the finger button
a Mac does something totally random
you do n't accidentally hit it every time you
you grab hold of the mouse
you rest the weight of your hand and arm
it would have been better if the bottom platform
hurts I am getting a numb/needles and pins feeling in
I ca n't believe these reviews are for

an attempt to reduce wrist pain
I 'm sure that it
it works for some people

The pain disappeared soon
use the " Ergonomic Quill Mouse"
it works like magic
I have tried to use this mouse for about a week
to use because of the horizontal hand position.Pros
The 3M mouse has a good hand position.Cons
The 3M mouse has awkward scrolling
I do n't know how people deal
people deal with non-wheel-based scrolling while
I use the 3M mouse
I find myself scrolling with
myself scrolling with the keyboard instead
The 3M mouse software does not produce any of the advertized extra scrolling features
The movement seems to require lifting the mouse when it
it wanders into a corner
heavier to do than a conventional mouse
to get back to the keyboard ( same for
this one has a tall stick to lift over

I find less accurate than a finger

try it
you may find yourself grabbing for

I will return it

Some keys require a heavy touch

any driver update .Anker email customer service
could not help me with installing

the driver update
I could not find an Anker user forum as well
Anker did contact me about the driver

WOW did they let me

I got in the mail

the mouse moves very slow
Went out
purchased a new one from Best Buy which
which works perfect

Broken part rattled around inside mouse
I had to buy another mouse because suddenly it
it disconects from the bluetooth
The scroll ball stops working
you can clean it with alcohol

the problem keeps coming back
I own a small business
I do n't have time to keep dealing with
time to keep dealing with the frustration of
constantly trying to keep my mouse functioning
my mouse functioning properly
I ended up buying a magic mouse
I wish I had never wasted my money
I had never wasted my money on this one
releasing beautiful hardware and software that no one at
Apple bothered to test adequately
Check various forums
you 'll learn the sad and , for those
who bought this workflow-killing nightmare

Cleaning the ball with alcohol can help

Do yourself a favor

they declare
I have to repair it myself
my mouse came i was
I hooked it up
guess what
the right click did not work
they would send a replacement I will be

I should have expected worst for the product
the product being a second hand item
The roller does n't work well
goes down but rarely goes
but rarely goes up
it does move down I have
I have a hard time with it
I would not buy from this person again
I would also not recommend getting a second hand mouse since I
I had this awful experience with it
using it for a while
I found it is
you can remember to lift your index finger when you
you want to have a right click using
a right click using your middle finger.The tracking
I got some troubles when edit photos
playing WOW.The scroll ball is
It worked perfectly for the first 4 months
got troubles everyday .Finally I
I have to give it up

it does n't work
I have to go to preferences
click the option for right click to make
right click to make it work

No options to copy and paste ( I use
I use spreadsheets alot

It logs on to bluetooth
I have to open bluetooth sometimes to get

I may go back to my old trusty Kensington
I have a difficult time getting
a difficult time getting it

I returned the mouse because 3
I tried to make a right click
it would not work

I 'm sure it has to do
it has to do with the way I
I use the mouse
I 'm not planning on changing
changing my angle
that makes it
it fail
I think a regular 2 button mouse is just perfect.
I wish this mouse had a real mechanical right button
this mouse had a real mechanical right button because it
I LOVED the scroll wheel

I ca n't say the same for the keyboard
I hate how LOUD the keyboard
it makes it HARD
HARD TO
some buttons have moved
I go to check where the proper one
the gold makes it a little difficult
to see .UPDATE
I 've had this mouse/keyboard combo for about a month
I had to change my star rating from a 3
the mouse has developed a high-pitch noise that appears and disappears
that appears and disappears sporadically
it 's starting to become really
annoying
I will still leave it with 2 versus 1
battery lasts a day
Do n't bother
Looks nice
does not work
Just does not work so had to return it
the mouse does not hold charge
the way to buy a new keyboard and mouse from a local store
noticed return date is
It looks pretty
Had it plugged in for
it plugged in for all
had to switch back
Locked my computer
I could n't get in
Had to change batteries
Keyboard does not always respond
I had to prop up one end to lay
one end to lay flat
it drives me nuts that
it skips letters when you
not work as in the red light
clicking anything
It 's in between
getting this keyboard
it worked beautiful at first
having it for about 3 weeks
this keyboard had overcharged the new Duracell batteries I placed
I placed inside them
exploded
The mouse had jerked my hand as soon as
it happened
the acid leaked everywhere
I know it looks
it looks shiny
I know it looks
it looks fancy
I 'm
anybody likes it
I can only assume the reviews are fake.This
fake.This feels like typing on
typing on a sponge
I have ever used
the whole keyboard bends just by resting
resting your hands on it.The mouse stays lit
it.The mouse stays lit all the time
I returned it immediately
I do n't know how
the batteries will last
Clicking also feels
feels spongy
to use
you could buy a normal mouse for less
that works far better
the mouse did not work well
The battery lasts very little
the cursor get 's stuck
it wo n't move up and down
moves side to side
Does not work with my IMac computer
Lights turn on
story .Do n't buy this product
it stopped working 2 weeks after I
I received it
no thumb drive to make the mouse work
nothing to make the mouse work
anyone guess where the batteries
the batteries go
It didnt meet our expectations
The car looks pretty in mouse shape
it doesnt have any door or compartment to put
any door or compartment to put the battery
I have emailed the vendor
waiting for the response
The item does n't work
It came with no receipt or instructions
I gave a 1 star rating because the lights
the lights came on like it
wo n't work the computer
The wheels broke off pretty soon after we
we started using it
It does work without the wheels
it 's awkward
to
went back to a old fashioned corded mouse after-the-fact
you buy it for your kid
they will not understand why it takes
it takes this long to get something
this long to get something from Amazon
they will ask you every
it arrives the wheels
the wheels will break
they will hate you
Keep freazing
Looked awesome on my desk at
Everyone commented on how cool it
it looked
this little bugger stopped working after 3 months
sits in my desk drawer for when
I get super mega board with my job
I take it out
play race car like a little kid till
I see the boss hoovering
the boss hoovering around
it 's still worth something if
My kids think these are
they 're right
it 's useless
The clicks do n't register anymore
could have easily gotten broken due to the cheapness of the product
did not come with a usb adapter to get
a usb adapter to get it
it to work
it ended up going in the trash
Wheels started falling off on day 1
It 's a cool looking mouse
it worked ok for a week or so
needed a mouse pad
it 's not working at all
Stopped working after 2 weeks
thought I 'd buy one to replace
I 'd buy one to replace my old cord mouse
one to replace my old cord mouse at work
it arrived
I used it for two days
you need to make sure you turn it
you turn it off everytime your done using
everytime your done using it
it does n't work at all
Thing only worked occasionally and only intermittently
worked occasionally and only intermittently at that
Do n't waste your money
to even use as a paperweight
I bought two of these mouses
NEITHER works correctly
moving the pointer
jumps forward in the direction you
forcing you recorrect backwards
relocate it
it "skipped a beat "
This erradic behaviour makes the mouse
the mouse extremely annoying to use
I got fed up
went back to using my Logitech mouse .Save
using my Logitech mouse .Save yourself some money
do n't buy this mouse
I ordered 2 of these
worked at all
The second one worked for a couple of
They did n't last long enough to even know how well
to even know how well they responded during
they responded during use

The red car worked for a couple of
They did n't last long enough to even know how well

I used it for a few weeks
it died
It 's now buried in my electronics graveyard
my electronics graveyard together with all the other electornic junk
I 've picked up through the years
learn
it 's
that 's why I gave
I gave it 2 stars
it did live for a few weeks
I guess I 'm lucky
I 'm lucky it survived
it survived even that long
to work the buttons
My mouse rattled
had the most amount of liftoff distance I
I 've ever seen with any mouse
I would never recommend this to anyone
received the mouse
installed the gaming software
plugged in the mouse
Everything works ....except the scroll wheel
I 've googled help
I 've gone through the gaming software
prayed ( even thought i
thought i 'm
i 'm an atheist )
nothing fixed the problem. I 'm leaving
I 'm leaving it a one star until
I can get it
it fixed
smash it with a hammer
side buttons didnt work
I have owned many , many Logitech mice over the last fifteen years or so
I can help it .For the past few years
I 've bought has eventually been clicking
has eventually been clicking twice
I click the left mouse button
It seems to happen sooner with each new mouse
I buy
this model lasted 6 months
it manifests
makes gaming impossible
frustrating as the mouse registers two clicks
the mouse registers two clicks when you
you click once
I do not care to open the thing up
try fixing it myself
I 'll just have to find a manufacturer whose mice do n't use
whose mice do n't use low-quality switches that break
that break so predictably
I bought a G400s mouse new in Nov 2013
Nov 2013 ( less than 50 bucks then )
) when I rebuilt
I rebuilt my computer
I thought it would be a decent replacement
began connecting and reconnecting frequently
I 'm a pack rat when it
it comes to computer parts
found my old MX518 in a box
I 've had since 1993
I do n't have to look for a G400s replacement
spend 1.5x more for a new one
click feels like it 's
it 's off by a good amount.Tried
emails still no real resolution .Went
it appears this mouse has
this mouse has button issues
I 'm still trying through Logitech support 2
seems they answer tickets randomly
go up to a week before
a different mouse or risk getting unlucky
using the mouse when it
it worked
the right click button does n't work properly
I think it is the right click spring
that may have broken
the button does n't return to the correct place
I can still use it
can no longer game
do any fast function with the right click now
Mouse worked fine
This resulted in a quick carpal tunnel on
The scroll wheel felt a little stiff at first compared
using ( the wonderful old MX-518
began to fail after about six years of full time use )
it feels quite similar
It 's a quite suitable replacement
the reviews have said relative to the MX-518
it will last at least as long as
I wrote a year ago
it 's intermittently failing
it enters the body of the mouse
It has never been mishandled
carried in a backpack or anything of the sort
been used on a single computer
I 've never dropped it
yanked on the cord at all
Logitech made good quality products
Middle scroll wheel set to low
The mouse works great for a few months
you own it
you plan on never moving it
on never moving it from your setup
securing the cable so
it will never catch
you 're out of 60 dollars
it 's a great mouse
the scroll wheel will not program
I would send it back
disposed of the packaging material never dreaming
dreaming that the device would be
button started getting stuck at every click
I would definitely return it if
I could
too excited about this purchase
granted
i purchased this to do CADD work
this to do CADD work for 8 hours
it tends to cramp your hands
i have HUGE hands
no way , shape or possibility could i use this for an extended amount
the implementation failed
which caused me to shoot
me to shoot a few friendlies
Returned as defective within 1 week
feel of the mouse I
I liked
i returned it
i got 4 of these
that would scroll the opposite direction by itself
that would n't register
that did n't match the box making returns difficult
that would scrape
crooked gliding feet
to give up on logitech after these experiences
I replaced it with seems
seems great so far
nothing compared to the g3
I regret the purchase
everything worked perfectly with the drivers
the drivers installed
to palm
the most negative helpful review stated
the left click went rogue
became strangely hard
to press
it feels really unnatural compared to
compared to the right click its very clicky and plasticy
I would steer clear of this mouse
does not feel good
makes a considerable difference
moves on its own
requiring a reboot
a reboot (
to do when wrestling with a ghost cursor )
This happened even after updating
updating to the most recent logitech software
switches direction for a moment when
scrolling quickly
I 'm not going to wait around hoping for
hoping for a software fix
It worked all of 3 mo
the typical Logitech cord disconnect issues happened
Constant connect /disconnect
the scroll wheel stopped working
never started again
there 's no way to change the functionality
no way to change the functionality of the scroll wheel
I could n't reassign the function or something )
yesterday it just stopped being able
stopped being able to click on
to click on things
I could still move the pointer around
could n't select anything.Tried unplugging / plugging back
anything.Tried unplugging / plugging back in
exploring software prefs
upgraded to windows 10
to recognize this WIRED mouse
no option to change any settings
they release software that is
you can trick the software into working
working by getting
getting a wireless logitech mouse
jumping through hoops
I have been a massive fan for years
I would ever recommend people stay away
people stay away from a logitech product.About
I bought a Razer Deathadder mouse
Looked great
worked horribly
could n't stand how poorly the Razer mouse
the Razer mouse performed
decided to go back to Logitech
I regret ever having tried another mouse
The G400S works flawlessly
I would highly recommend
loved it
wore it out.If you
you comprehend that
you 'll understand this.This G400s is
receiving it I was appalled when
I took it out the packaging
the packaging to see a plastic cable
I mean come on
you want a sturdy braided cable
yanking the cable
it would come out easily
break the mouse
You would have expected them to change this
them to change this in there latest revision
they have done here is change the coating.Also
I sent it back
went with the steelseries sensei
the steelseries sensei raw
do recommend
being nice and light
found the DPI down button would not work
button would not work unless pressed
pressed with above normal force
's DPI buttons engage without effort
Logitech needs to make the DPI buttons
to make the DPI buttons work
the DPI buttons work better on-the-fly
I do n't feel much difference over the G400
got my new G400S today
I took it out of
it feels
I did n't even get as far as plugging
plugging it in
I will try the G500.This mouse does not feel good
the G500.This mouse does not feel good in my hand
you 're lucky
Do not buy this remote
Spend a couple bucks
a couple bucks more
get the ourspop remote
my 2nd rasberry pi trying to save a couple
a couple bucks
correct have to click the same button 2-3 times to get
2-3 times to get a response
feels cheap
there 's no touchpad
it takes AAA batteries
Left click does n't work 1 out of
4 times pressed
pretty aggravating while browsing
i got this open and plugged it
this open and plugged it in i
i noticed that the lights did not work
the lights did not work at all on
using it the first day of use
the left click started to no work
get one that is a little more
all went bad
started having issues with the left click a once
a 50 or so 1 would fail
Hard to open emails
to play any game the mouse pad
I buy a 7 button mouse I expect
I expect all 7 buttons to have a function
all 7 buttons to have a function within a game or program
you dont need their very specific function
One changes the DPI
I could see these functions being useful
these functions being useful for some people
they 're hardcoded
I spent money on a falsely advertised product
I need it
It looks nice bit its not compatable
i wasted this buy
's performance dropped
There 's a lag when I
I click
Many clicks do n't get registered
I play only
I ca n't pick this mouse up
you 're using it for gaming
it slips about your hand
you can reposition your hand
package came with only the mouse pad
the package containing the mouse pad clearly says
says it contains
it contains the mouse
My mouse pad came in
my mouse did
I do
the shipment arrived the only contents inside were
Returned it
the item shipped without complete parts
It stopped working within a month of
having it.It was
did me no good
got it
opened the box it came
it came in
I tried to use my 3wheeled car
it worked fine until my computer screen
my computer screen went to
moving the 3 wheeled car to wake
the 3 wheeled car to wake the computer up
the computer would n't recognize the mouse
my 3 wheeled car/mouse sits on the shelf to remind
the shelf to remind me beware of
me beware of what you
you order on line
got the USB receiver with my mouse
does n't work
arrived broken
It died in little over
I did n't use it at all
it sucked down two AAA batteries every few days
I ran out
I went back to my old mouse
I got new batteries
put new ones in
They lasted two days
I put another set in
They lasted an hour
I put another set in
it would n't come on
there 's my experience
Hope it helps
it helps you
I had to send it back
it looks cute in the picture
it came broken
It would have been adorable if it
it had n't been such shoddy material
the mouse broke off in the port
the mouse does n't work at all
we got this maybe a month ago
it should note have broken so easily
Did n't even come w the part to put in
the part to put in computer to link
computer to link to mouse
Did n't recieve the u .s
I ca n't use the mouse
I received it in the mail
it broke a few moments after I
I opened it
I had to return the item for a refund
refunding my money
the chip to make it a mouse
that cost twice the price of
least to use this for very fine or precise movements
editing a photo but for general use
general use browsing the web it has been
it has been a very nice mouse
find I prefer the small removable base piece off
I prefer the small removable base piece off the mouse
it allows me to better place
I want it
it to go
I read some reviews mention the quality
some reviews mention the quality of the feel
the rubber/plastics have a solid feel
the buttons have a nice " click " to them
I ca n't see paying 4 times as much for a name brand ergo mouse
this one works so well at such an affordable price
. ***6-29-2015***UPDATE
I have been involved
working with and around/in the IT field for about 15 years
this mouse created an issue I have never seen
I have never seen before .At first
it created a situation that at
had me thinking my PC was
me thinking my PC was in
the BIOS failed to load
the screen would filter in sort of
like loading a webpage using
a webpage using a 56K modem
I built this PC some time ago
it runs pretty much 24/7 I
thought it must have
it must have a heat or hardware problem
I have never seen such a thing
I have seen a bad USB cable cause a PC to hang
a PC to hang on boot
to say the least
has again now simply by unplugging
unplugging this mouse
I do intend to email customer service
see what they have to say about
they have to say about this
I do n't feel comfortable using it
comfortable using it long term
term now
I will try to come back
update how customer service handles this situation
I edited my first review of this mouse
added the troubles it caused me
it caused me I sent
I sent the seller an email
They responded VERY quickly
issued a full refund in addition
could n't ask for better support from a seller
gets a 1 star for the issues it
it created
the seller gets a 10 for stellar support
I tried to email it to them
they will read it here .-----Hi
I bought the Delux M618 vertical mouse
The mouse feels high quality
the mouse design has these problems
to reach so I can only press half
I can only press half of it--which
I 'm unable to move it
to move it straight up/down--it tends to move diagonal
tends to move diagonal up/down at a 60 degree angle
moving it quickly
Delux fix these problems by making
making a smaller version
Please make the grip be less fat at
make the mouse less tall
please make the rubber grip pattern at the thumb be
horizontal lines to make the mouse easier to
got it
you could make it detachable )
) the buttons are in
granted im a guy with slightly bigger
feels like it was designed for
The product lasted a little over 3 months
stopped working
It worked greate while
it lasted
looked sleek
I have to replace this set every 3 months
I do n't like the mouse at all
I think its super cheap looking in person
feels like a toy
the mouse drives me crazy because
it feels like gear-movement
do n't like the fact that the backspace button on
my finger keeps hitting the 'delete ' button beside it
I could care less for the entire purchase
I 'd skip this purchase
move onto something else
you want to purchase it anyway
make me an offer
I 'll sell you mine
I 've literally had to replace the batteries in the keyboard
Do not buy
I bought this product cause it
this product cause it matched the look
it matched the look of my monitor
Lesson learned
buy from this company again
Please do n't buy this .. I think
I think it is
workingI bought two
same did not work ..Do
buy amazon buyer
using it just a few times
the mouse stopped working
Mouse wheel stopped working in less than
I returned it today
The zero key had a mind of it
it 's own
leave reviews
felt like I
I needed to
they do n't really function the way you
you expect
you expect them to
them to me
They 've moved the keys slightly so that
it 's incredibly hard to type if
to type if you 're used
you 're used to a traditional keyboard
It 's almost impossible to use the keypad
to use the keypad since the delete button is
Imagine typing a phone number
typing a dash
you 're deleting your number.As for the mouse
it 's
that works quite how you
you would expect
order to get the thing to "wake
the thing to "wake up
you have to click a button
proceed
I 've never had a mouse that you
you have to wake up before using
before using it
does n't track smoothly even with a mouse pad
I gave it 2 stars is
it looks nice ( as pictured )
bought this keyboard
the shift key has fallen off
Bad ! Already breaking
numbers popping off
I 've only had it
Having the full sized keyboard is
the product stopped working after approximately 60 days
Going to see if
get the keyboard to work at
the keyboard to work at all
sticks .Look for a BETTER quality product save
it arrived
I opened the keyboard box
One popped back in
the other key had a snapped plastic peice
The set up looked
looked great
felt flimsy
felt like a toy
my old Logitech mouse felt better
The products looked good
the keys being broken
I may have decided to just keep it
Going to order a different brand
The number lock does not work
Going out of town for
I want to return it
to use
using it daily for months
have trouble finding keys
the mouse died 2 months after I
I bought which is one month
to return it under the standard warranty
The keyboard has small delete

to use
The items do look nice though
I love the size of this keyboard and mouse
they fit easily in my laptop bag
I received
does n't work
I flipped it over to check
it over to check the batteries
the keys fell off
I 'm hoping I was
the other reviews mentioned this
Product looks great
it loses connection every couple minutes
I have owned
Keyboard does n't work well
Have to press down on the letters
them to work
does n't function very well
did n't even connect it
put back in box
shipped back
It looks sharp
feels like cheap junk
the key presses felt great
which ends up being a huge pain in the a**
you 're a fast typer
It means well
it feels like something you
you would get out of the discount bin
I ended up sending it
sending it back because it
it kept dropping connection to my laptop
The combo looks great if I
I could use it
came with no usb dongle or anything to connect
no usb dongle or anything to connect it
Was really hoping to use this with my desk set
my desk set up
you can see you I had to use
I had to use easy access keyboard
Keyboard and mouse feel cheap
Pick up some good rechargeable batteries if you
you buy this keyboard
the mouse will go into a save
happens randomly when I 'm actually using
I 'm actually using it
the combo looks gorgeous
I think I 'll open
I 'll open the mouse
try to solder a cable to force it
a cable to force it to be
I fail and just destroy the mouse
I 'll just look for a wireless white mouse that
that looks similar and works
I 'll need after using this mouse
using this mouse for more than
a month )
the keyboard gets 5 stars
it sits idle to get working
to get working again
you hit the space bar
it will not work
This should not have passed quality control
Tried to take it apart to fix
to fix it
ended up just throwing
throwing it
it out
The signal would not go through to my computer
pressing the keys
when compared to other branded items
the keyboard size ,product picture shows 16.4 inch
a little bigger one.Completely deceived by the product picture

u can get it to cover
it to cover your mouse feet
my Sensei Wireless glides 10 times better than with
this applied on my Razer Destructor 2

the reviews says
Tape works fine
there creases on each side of
you need to cut the creased parts away to use
to use the middle portion
having tape
might as well have a sheet
you use a cloth mouse pad
I apply the tape onto my mouse feet.The
my mouse pad and mouse feet cause the tape to come off
the tape to come off from the corners
it feels so sticky when I
I move my mouse .Do n't buy
buy this
I bought this to try to keep my new Mighty Mouse
this to try to keep my new Mighty Mouse from scraping
scraping the desk
the tape stuck well to the runners
to trim
Its very smooth and stayed on
it did not fix the badly designed mouse

You can only glue it over the existing ones.Also
installed
it does not give any significant advantage
feels hard to move
to move around
This product has negative review on competitor website
to not believe it
still bought this one
I bought this tape to try and add some more life
this tape to try and add some more life into my razer diamondback
I pulled some off to cover the three feet
some off to cover the three feet on the mouse
cut around the feet for a more exact size
I cleaned up the mess
began gaming .First thing I noticed was
I noticed was that it
it felt like it
felt like there was more friction
Assuming it was maybe the pad
I swapped
to test
I tested a cloth steelseries qck
a cloth steelseries qck pad
Nothing changed
I ripped off the tape from
tested the original mouse again to see if
to see if it was just me perceiving
the mouse started to glide nice , smooth , and quick
nice , smooth , and quick again.Simply put
it leaving no residue is
I think maybe for some different brand mice
bought a razer deathadder to replace

the deathadder compared to my diamondback are
I 'm currently using a Razer scarab mouse pad
mentioned before moves smoothly
makes a grinding sound when moving around on

I guess razer 's mouse feet quality has dropped
's mouse feet quality has dropped over the years
my deathadder to see if it
it improves it
I will update my review once I
I give it a go.UPDATE
Put some of the tape on
It did help smooth out the deathadder a little bit
used my kershaw to cut around the edges
my kershaw to cut around the edges for
I could find the material my original razer diamondback feet were made
it depends on what type of
you have and the type of feet
feet your trying to replace/cover with this tape
I can say as far as the razer diamondback
the razer diamondback goes it ca n't compete with
it ca n't compete with the diamondbacks original feet
ca n't scroll properly
I 've got to hand it to Logitech
I 'd wager about 6 months before this mouse
this mouse has double clicking problems in it
it 's left and right mouse buttons
this mouse looks perfect
reality does n't live up to the hype
The build quality is
that feels like its going
its going to snap
the button builds
they did n't respond well
built
It takes a lot of force
its easy to slide off
It 's just uncomfortable and awkward
to use
a rubble one would have been smarter
hey went with metal
metal does n't mean durable
moving the mouse around it
it rattles loudly
feels like its going to fall out.I
its going to fall out.I had
out.I had high hopes
to use
I will look at it again
they can fix the quality issues
I would happily pay much more for a higher quality mouse

Somebody has left this in the design
I work with a mouse sometimes
20hrs a day
I want while working in

it 's going to come apart
expected a quiet

I have to move my hand around
to use all buttons with speed

I had a smaller hand

I 'm honestly
one side being bigger than the other
it feels so sensitive when using

it 's really heavy
it 's hard to unconsciously turn this thing
to unconsciously turn this thing when your looking
your looking around in a game
I 'm in the process of
returning these and will probably get something with
these and will probably get something with a more simpler design
I had a similar mouse from Logitech
this one has a bottom that just falls
playing
Its just poorly made
that comes configured as a DPS setting
rebind to something more useful
you end up clicking the left mouse button
clicking the left mouse button along with this button
The Logitech G700 has a much better design
I decided to try this model out
wish I 'd just went with the latest incarnation
I 'd just went with the latest incarnation of

you purchase this because
you hold onto the serial number
It feels really flimsy
I ended up returning due to

making for a very annoying back scroll from where
it happened nearly every time I used
I used the free scroll.That complaint is pretty common
that has become so common in Logitech mice
the double click issue ) that I think
I think I am going to have to switch manufacturers
i got a new one

I had originally purchased this adapter to add bluetooth capability
this adapter to add bluetooth capability to my somewhat dated HP laptop
I bought it along with
the SoundBot SB240 bluetooth headset to ensure maximum compatibility between the two devices
The headset had shortcomings on its own
compounded them with its unreliable functionality .The device
installs easily enough
will pair with any bluetooth device quickly with
I routinely encountered is that
the adapter would completely disable itself
lose all functionality the moment the computer was powered
being in any soft sleep or hibernation mode
would not remember the adapter was plugged
would not allow it to be re-enabled without
I click on the grayed out
icon to turn the radio back on
I found to occasionally avoid this was to manually disable the bluetooth radio
myself before putting the laptop in sleep mode
re-enabling it on wake up
that would not guarantee it to work
it to work as
the adapter would *still* stubbornly refuse to re-activate without
refuse to re-activate without a full reboot
unplugging/re-plugging the adapter would help
rebooting the computer
to get the adapter working and pairing with my devices
the adapter working and pairing with my devices again
defeated any purpose it may have served for
it may have served for convenient wireless device connectivity
It left me favoring my old physically wired devices
me favoring my old physically wired devices over the wireless ones
I 'd bought it for. I
it for. I eventually ordered
ordered the Kinivo Btd-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter as an alternative
it 's twice the price of
you do get what you pay
you pay for
to go on wake up
No re-enables or reboots needed
I have Soundbot wireless headphones

a headset setting instead of the speaker option
which altered the sound

did i think a mouse could cause so many problems
a mouse could cause so many problems inside
this mouse made my computer blue screen
this mouse i have never had a issue ever before

I have to say though the mouse itself
itself looks nice
felt semi-comfortable the finger placement for my index
I 'm accustomed to but everything else fit like
everything else fit like a glove
would of gotten used to the placement
enjoyed this mouse quite a lot if
i 'd had more than 20 minutes total
using
I 'm really disappointed this did n't work
this did n't work out
considered for a second just ordering
ordering another
i do n't want to wait another week for the chance
rinse and repeat .*edit*
forgot to mention i think the green led or w/e is
i think the green led or w/e is in
it would just get a weird light blue color when i
i set it to neon green
I 'm really disappointed honestly
I got the mouse on time
I opened the box
It does n't work at all
threw my money away
the mouse pointer jumps all over
to use
I cannot return or exchange
I 'm using it currently

making my mouse fly around
move not at all ...right out
this product did not even work

to do
adding all the gimmicks of extra buttons and sensors
contacted the manufacturer regarding
the manufacturer regarding the acceleration
DOA issue
I have used several multi-button gaming mice of this design
the creature would not install properly
I 'm saying this weird critter was not recognized by
would not do a darn thing
I had a Red Dragon mouse with a very similar button setup
that functioned well for much less
I hate to say it
I hate this mouse
I gave it a serious try
I wanted it
it to work
felt bad in my hand
my thumb made it nearly impossible
My thumb kept on sliding off
on sliding off the side of
to grasp without actually applying quite a bit
actually applying quite a bit of pressure
